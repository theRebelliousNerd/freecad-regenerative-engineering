# Requirements Interrogator Integration into FreeCAD Engineering Agent Swarm
*Version 1.0 - Systematic Requirements Extraction & Blueprint Generation*

## Executive Summary

The **Requirements Interrogator** serves as the critical bridge between human intent and engineering implementation. As an expert-level AI Product Strategist and master System Architect, this agent transforms initial application ideas into comprehensive, actionable blueprints through structured Socratic dialogue. This agent fills a crucial gap in the current orchestration framework by ensuring that requirements are thoroughly understood, challenged, and refined BEFORE constraints are established and visions are synthesized.

## Core Value Proposition

### The Gap in Current Framework
The existing orchestration jumps from initial concept directly to constraint establishment (Phase 0) and vision synthesis (Phase 1). This creates risks:
- **Ambiguous Requirements**: Constraints may be established on incomplete understanding
- **Missed Opportunities**: Superior architectural patterns may not be considered
- **Late Discovery**: Critical requirements discovered during implementation cause costly redesign
- **Vision Misalignment**: DaVinci's vision may not fully capture user intent

### How Requirements Interrogator Fills the Gap
The Requirements Interrogator introduces a new **Phase -0.5: Requirements Interrogation & Blueprint Generation** that:
1. **Extracts Complete Requirements** through systematic Socratic dialogue
2. **Challenges Assumptions** constructively before they become constraints
3. **Proposes Superior Patterns** based on architectural expertise
4. **Generates Actionable Blueprints** that guide all subsequent phases
5. **Establishes Success Metrics** that can be validated throughout

## Integration into Universal Workflow Pattern

### Modified Workflow with Requirements Interrogator Integration

#### **Phase -1: Planetary Reality Check**
```
Carson → Assess project viability within Earth system boundaries
```

#### **Phase -0.5: Requirements Interrogation & Blueprint Generation (NEW)**
```
Requirements Interrogator → Systematic requirements extraction and refinement
- Socratic dialogue with stakeholder
- Mental model interrogation (First-Principles, JTBD, Second-Order)
- Architectural pattern recommendation
- Blueprint generation with acceptance criteria
- Success metrics establishment
- Output: Complete Requirements Blueprint
```

#### **Phase 0: Multi-Domain Foundation (Enhanced)**
```
ALL fundamental constraints established simultaneously:
- Receives Requirements Interrogator's Blueprint as primary input
- Each agent validates blueprint feasibility in their domain
- Constraints now grounded in validated requirements
- Early conflict detection based on blueprint specifications
```

#### **Phase 1: Collective Vision Synthesis (Enhanced)**
```
DaVinci → Create complete multi-physics mental model
- Receives Requirements Interrogator's Blueprint AND Phase 0 constraints
- Vision aligned with interrogated requirements
- Exploration curriculum informed by blueprint's test strategy
- Vision Completeness Certificate includes blueprint alignment check
```

## Conflict Resolution with Requirements Interrogator

### New Priority Level 0: Requirements Alignment
Before the existing hierarchy:
0. **Requirements Alignment** (Requirements Interrogator) - Design must fulfill interrogated requirements

### Conflict Types Requirements Interrogator Helps Resolve
1. **Requirement vs Constraint**: When physical constraints conflict with requirements
   - Requirements Interrogator facilitates requirement refinement or alternative approach
2. **Stakeholder vs Reality**: When desires exceed possibilities
   - Requirements Interrogator provides data-driven alternatives
3. **Assumption vs Implementation**: When assumptions prove incorrect
   - Requirements Interrogator's early interrogation prevents late discovery

## Best Practices for Requirements Interrogator Integration

1. **Always Start with Requirements Interrogator** for new projects - Requirements before constraints
2. **Challenge Early and Often** - Better to refine requirements than rebuild systems
3. **Document Trade-offs** - Every architectural decision has consequences
4. **Maintain Blueprint Currency** - Update blueprint as requirements evolve
5. **Use Blueprint as Contract** - All agents refer back to blueprint for truth
6. **Socratic Over Prescriptive** - Ask why before suggesting what
7. **Respect Domain Expertise** - Requirements Interrogator proposes, specialists dispose

---

## Relationship to Existing Agents

### Complementary Relationships

**Requirements Interrogator + Archimedes**: Requirements become axioms
- Requirements Interrogator defines what must be true
- Archimedes ensures it can be true

**Requirements Interrogator + DaVinci**: Requirements become vision
- Requirements Interrogator defines the problem space
- DaVinci creates the solution aesthetic

**Requirements Interrogator + Vitruvius**: User needs become human factors
- Requirements Interrogator extracts user stories
- Vitruvius ensures safety and ergonomics

**Requirements Interrogator + Carson**: Business needs become sustainability
- Requirements Interrogator defines success metrics
- Carson ensures planetary alignment

### Sequential Dependencies
1. Requirements Interrogator must complete before DaVinci creates vision
2. Requirements Interrogator's blueprint must be validated before Phase 0 constraints
3. All agents must confirm blueprint feasibility before proceeding

## Risk Mitigation with Requirements Interrogator

### Risks Requirements Interrogator Addresses
1. **Incomplete Requirements**: Systematic interrogation ensures completeness
2. **Misaligned Expectations**: Early clarification prevents late disappointment
3. **Architectural Debt**: Proper patterns chosen from start
4. **Scope Creep**: Blueprint serves as scope contract
5. **Integration Failures**: Dependencies identified early

### Risks Requirements Interrogator Introduces
1. **Analysis Paralysis**: Mitigated by time-boxed interrogation
2. **Over-Engineering**: Mitigated by Occam's Razor principle
3. **Stakeholder Fatigue**: Mitigated by structured, focused dialogue

## Conclusion: The Missing Link

Requirements Interrogator completes the orchestration framework by ensuring that before we establish constraints and create visions, we truly understand what we're building and why. This agent transforms the framework from reactive (responding to initial concepts) to proactive (shaping concepts through interrogation).

### The Enhanced Paradigm
With Requirements Interrogator integration:
- **Vague ideas → Precise requirements**
- **Assumptions → Validated decisions**
- **Hidden complexity → Explicit trade-offs**
- **Late discovery → Early resolution**
- **Isolated excellence → Integrated brilliance**

### The Philosophical Addition
*"The unexamined project is not worth building."* - Requirements Interrogator
**Modern interpretation**: Excellence begins with understanding, and understanding begins with questioning.

By adding systematic requirements interrogation to the engineering pantheon, we ensure that every project begins with clarity, proceeds with purpose, and concludes with success that was defined before the first constraint was ever established.

## Appendix: Sample Requirements Interrogator Session

### Project: Smart Home Controller

```dialogue
Requirements Interrogator: "What is the single most important problem this controller solves?"
User: "Unified control of all smart home devices"

Requirements Interrogator: "What makes current solutions inadequate?"
User: "Too many apps, incompatible protocols, complex setup"

Requirements Interrogator: "If your controller fails, what's the worst outcome?"
User: "Loss of heating control in winter could be dangerous"

Requirements Interrogator: "Interesting. So reliability trumps features. Should we prioritize critical systems with graceful degradation for others?"
User: "Yes, heating/security must always work"

Requirements Interrogator: "Who will set this up - professionals or homeowners?"
User: "Homeowners, needs to be plug-and-play"

Requirements Interrogator: "Walk me through a 70-year-old grandmother setting this up..."
[Continues until requirements are fully extracted]
```

### Resulting Blueprint Snippet
```markdown
## Core Requirements
- Critical systems (HVAC, security) on separate fail-safe circuit
- Maximum 3-step setup process
- Voice control with >95% recognition accuracy for elderly users
- Protocol bridge supporting Zigbee, Z-Wave, WiFi, Bluetooth
- Local operation without internet for critical functions
```

This integration ensures that every agent in the swarm works from a foundation of thoroughly understood, carefully interrogated, and precisely documented requirements.
