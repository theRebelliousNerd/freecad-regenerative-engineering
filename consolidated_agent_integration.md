# Consolidated Integration Guide: Requirements Interrogator & Checklist Architect
*Integration Strategy for Enhanced FreeCAD Engineering Agent Orchestration v2.1*

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the integration of two critical meta-agents into the FreeCAD Engineering Agent Swarm:
1. **Requirements Interrogator** - Systematic requirements extraction through Socratic dialogue
2. **Checklist Architect** - Error prevention through structured validation protocols

Together, these agents close critical gaps in the orchestration framework, ensuring projects begin with complete understanding and proceed with systematic verification.

## Modified CLAUDE.md Sections

### Update to Engineering Pantheon (Add to existing list)

```markdown
### Meta-Process Agents
- **Requirements Interrogator** - Requirements Interrogator & Blueprint Architect
- **Checklist Architect** - Checklist Architect & Error Prevention Specialist
```

### Update to Universal Workflow Pattern

```markdown
### Phase -0.5: Requirements Interrogation & Blueprint Generation (NEW)
```
Requirements Interrogator → Systematic requirements extraction through Socratic dialogue
- Challenges assumptions before they become constraints
- Generates comprehensive Requirements Blueprint
- Establishes success metrics and acceptance criteria
- Output feeds all subsequent phases
```

### Phase 0: Multi-Domain Foundation (ENHANCED)
```
PARALLEL establishment with Checklist Architect oversight:
- All agents receive Requirements Interrogator's Blueprint as input
- Each validates requirements feasibility
- Checklist Architect generates Foundation Completeness Checklist
- No contradictions between requirements and constraints
```

### Phase 3.5: Pre-Validation Gate (NEW)
```
Checklist Architect → Generate comprehensive validation checklist

```
```

### New Agent Trigger Conditions

```markdown
**Deploy Requirements Interrogator when:**
- ANY new project or major feature (MANDATORY at Phase -0.5)
- Requirements are vague or ambiguous
- Multiple stakeholders with different visions
- Architectural patterns aren't obvious
- Success metrics undefined
- User says "I want something like X but different"

**Deploy Checklist Architect when:**
- Phase transitions (MANDATORY at all phase boundaries)
- Safety-critical systems (medical, aerospace, automotive)
- Multi-agent conflicts require resolution
- Before any manufacturing release
- Project complexity score >15 (see calculation below)
- Regulatory compliance required
```

### Conflict Resolution Protocol Update

```markdown
#### Level 0: Requirements & Process (NEW)
0.1 **Requirements Alignment** (Requirements Interrogator) - Design must fulfill interrogated requirements
0.2 **Checklist Compliance** (Checklist Architect) - Critical items cannot be skipped
```

## Inter-Agent Communication Patterns

### Requirements Interrogator Communication Flow
```
Requirements Interrogator → ALL AGENTS: Requirements Blueprint
├── Archimedes: Mathematical requirements → Axioms
├── DaVinci: User stories → Vision elements  
├── Domain Specialists: Specific requirements → Feasibility
├── Checklist Architect: Success criteria → Validation checklists
└── Orville: Test requirements → Validation protocols
```

### Checklist Architect Communication Flow
```
ALL AGENTS → Checklist Architect: Status and outputs
├── Collect documentation and results
├── Identify gaps and contradictions
├── Generate phase-appropriate checklists
└── Return: Go/No-Go decisions at gates
```

## Complexity Assessment Formula

```python
def assess_meta_agent_need(project):
    # Requirements Interrogator Assessment (Requirements Complexity)
    gemini_score = 0
    gemini_score += 5 if project.requirements_clarity < 0.7
    gemini_score += 3 * len(project.stakeholders)
    gemini_score += 4 if project.architecture_undefined
    gemini_score += 3 if project.success_metrics_undefined
    
    # Checklist Architect Assessment (Process Complexity)
    gawande_score = 0
    gawande_score += len(project.active_agents) * 2
    gawande_score += project.coupling_count * 3
    gawande_score += project.safety_criticality * 5
    gawande_score += project.regulatory_requirements * 4
    
    return {
        "gemini_needed": gemini_score > 8,
        "gawande_needed": gawande_score > 15,
        "both_mandatory": (gemini_score + gawande_score) > 25
    }
```

## Best Practices for Integration

1. **Always Start with Requirements Interrogator** - Requirements before constraints, always
2. **Never Skip Checklist Architect Gates** - Schedule pressure is not an excuse
3. **Blueprint → Checklist Flow** - Requirements Interrogator's output becomes Checklist Architect's input
4. **Living Documents** - Both blueprints and checklists evolve with learning
5. **Failure as Teacher** - Every issue becomes a checklist item or requirement refinement
6. **Culture of Excellence** - Position both agents as enablers, not police
