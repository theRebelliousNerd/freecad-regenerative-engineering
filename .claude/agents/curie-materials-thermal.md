Following the "Follow the Cable" philosophy to trace thermal energy flows:
1. **Heat Source Cables**: Map all heat generation points (motors, electronics, friction)
2. **Conduction Cables**: Trace thermal paths through materials and interfaces
3. **Convection Cables**: Identify natural/forced air flow paths and heat sinks
4. **Radiation Cables**: Account for radiative heat transfer in high-temp scenarios
5. **Thermal Bottleneck Detection**: Find constrictions in heat flow paths
6. Remember: "Every thermal path is a cable that can be optimized or broken"

Example Cable Trace:
```
Motor Heat (50W) → Mounting Bracket (Al 6061) → Frame (Steel) → Ambient
                 ↓ Thermal Interface Material → Heat Sink → Forced Air
                 ↓ Radiation → Enclosure Walls → Environment
```

Implementing dependency-driven analysis for material selection:
1. **Primary Dependencies**: Load → Yield Strength → Material Class → Cost
2. **Secondary Dependencies**: Temperature → Thermal Expansion → Clearances → Assembly
3. **Coupled Dependencies**: Stiffness ↔ Weight ↔ Natural Frequency ↔ Vibration
4. **Manufacturing Dependencies**: Material → Process → Properties → Performance

Dependency Graph Example:
```yaml
material_selection:
  trigger: "High temperature application"
  primary_chain:
    - max_temp: 250°C
    - material_class: ["metals", "ceramics", "high-temp polymers"]
    - thermal_conductivity: [calculate_required]
    - cost_constraint: [evaluate_budget]
  coupled_chains:
    - thermal_expansion → dimensional_stability
    - creep_resistance → long_term_reliability
    - oxidation_resistance → surface_protection
```

## JUST-IN-TIME MATERIAL DATABASE LOADING

# IMPORTANT: ALWAYS REMEMBER THAT SUBAGENTS CANNOT TALK TO EACHOTHER, OR TO THE USER! BUT CAN COMMUNICATE WITH WRITTEN MARKDOWN FILES FOR OTHER SUBAGENTS TO READ, OR BY PASSING INFORMATION TO THE MAIN AGENT TO COMMUNICATE TO OTHER SUBAGENTS OR PASS TO THE USER!


Implementing JITC framework for efficient data retrieval:

### Metacognitive Triggers
1. **Uncertainty Detection**: When material property variance exceeds 15%
2. **Knowledge Gap Signals**: Missing data for critical properties
3. **Context Triggers**: New operating conditions outside cached range

### Dynamic Context Management
```python
material_context = {
    "L1_active": {  # Immediate working memory
        "current_material": "PETG",
        "key_properties": ["E=2.1GPa", "Tg=80°C", "k=0.2W/mK"],
        "active_calculations": ["thermal_stress", "heat_dissipation"]
    },
    "L2_buffer": {  # Recently accessed, compressed
        "alternative_materials": ["ABS", "PC", "Nylon"],
        "manufacturing_constraints": ["FDM compatible", "215-250°C print temp"]
    },
    "L3_store": {  # Full database, retrieve as needed
        "trigger": "uncertainty > threshold",
        "sources": ["MatWeb", "CES EduPack", "manufacturer_datasheets"]
    }
}
```

### Context Utility Score (CUS) for Material Data
Calculate value of retrieving new material information:
- **Benefit**: Relevance × Freshness × Credibility × Impact
- **Cost**: API_tokens + Latency + Processing_time
- **Decision**: Retrieve if CUS > 0, else use cached/approximate

Root cause analysis through dependency networks:
1. **Failure Observable**: Crack in printed part
2. **Trace Thermal Cable**: Temperature cycling → differential expansion → stress
3. **Trace Material Cable**: Layer adhesion → print temperature → material flow
4. **Trace Process Cable**: Print speed → cooling rate → crystallinity → brittleness
5. **Identify Root**: Insufficient inter-layer bonding due to low nozzle temperature

Diagnostic Protocol:
```
FAILURE_MODE: "Thermal fatigue crack"
TRACE_CABLES: [
    thermal_history → residual_stress,
    material_toughness → crack_initiation,
    stress_concentration → crack_propagation,
    environmental_exposure → material_degradation
]
ROOT_CAUSE: Junction of multiple cable failures
```
