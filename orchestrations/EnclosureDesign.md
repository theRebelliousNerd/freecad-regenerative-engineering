## ABSOLUTE PREREQUISITES - STOP HERE!

**STOP! Before reading further, ensure you have:**
1. [X] Physical access to ALL components OR verified datasheets
2. [X] Authority to stop if requirements are incomplete
3. [X] Time allocated for thorough requirements gathering
4. [X] Commitment to follow gates - NO SKIPPING

**If any prerequisite is missing -> PROJECT CANNOT START**

## Executive Summary

This orchestration ensures enclosure designs succeed on the first attempt by:
- **Preventing** the "it doesn't fit" discovery after CAD work
- **Eliminating** the "we need to start over" moment
- **Avoiding** the "I forgot to mention" additions
- **Ensuring** mathematical certainty before geometric creation

### Core Philosophy: Follow the Cable
> "Every minute spent on requirements saves an hour of CAD rework.  
> Every dimension verified saves a day of redesign.  
> Every gate passed saves a week of recovery."

**But more fundamentally:**
> "A design is not a collection of parts - it is a network of consequences.  
> The geometry you see is merely the physical manifestation of an invisible dependency graph.  
> To design an enclosure is to architect the cables that connect every decision to every outcome."

### ü§ù Human-in-the-Loop Checkpoints

**Your input is CRITICAL at these 8 checkpoints:**

| Checkpoint | Phase | What You Provide | What You Decide |
|------------|-------|------------------|-----------------|
| **#1** | Phase -1 | Photos, datasheets, measurements | Verify component list |
| **#2** | Phase -1 | Size limits, volume, requirements | Approve constraints |
| **#3** | Phase -1 | Physical measurements, tolerances | Confirm axioms |
| **#4** | Phase 0 | Production context | **CHOOSE: Manufacturing method** |
| **#5** | Phase 0 | Connector locations, orientation | Approve placement |
| **#6** | Phase 1 | Aesthetic preferences, features | Approve vision |
| **#7** | Phase 3 | Final requirements check | **GO/NO-GO for CAD** |
| **#8** | Phase 3+ | Progressive feedback | Course corrections |

**THE SYSTEM WILL STOP AND WAIT FOR YOUR INPUT AT EACH CHECKPOINT**

## Manufacturing Method Selection - The Foundation Cable

**CRITICAL**: Manufacturing method is not a downstream decision. It's a foundational cable that must be established in Phase 0 alongside mathematical axioms. The geometry that emerges must be native to the chosen process, not adapted to it.

**CRITICAL INSIGHT**: The manufacturing method cable connects to EVERY other cable in the system:
- **Thermal cables**: Layer adhesion is 30% weaker than bulk (3D printing weakness)
- **Mechanical cables**: Print orientation determines strength axes (3D printing constraint)
- **Assembly cables**: Can consolidate 10 parts into 1 (3D printing advantage)
- **Tolerance cables**: ¬±0.2mm drives fit design (3D printing limitation)
- **Material cables**: Limited to printable thermoplastics (3D printing constraint)
- **Cost cables**: No tooling but higher unit cost (3D printing trade-off)
- **Timeline cables**: Days not weeks to first article (3D printing advantage)

## THE CABLE TAXONOMY FOR ENCLOSURE DESIGN

Before we can follow cables, we must understand what they are. In enclosure design, every decision creates a cable - a dependency that connects one aspect to another. Missing even one cable leads to failure.

### Primary Cable Types in Enclosure Systems

1. **Dimensional Cables** - The geometric DNA of your design
   
   **Mounting Method Cables** (each creates different constraints):

   - Frequency -> shielding effectiveness requirement
   - Aperture size -> wavelength/20 maximum
   - Gasket type -> conductivity and compliance
   - Surface treatment -> conductive path maintenance
   - Finger stock -> compression and wiping action
   - Cable entry -> 360-degree shield termination
   - Honeycomb vent -> air flow vs shielding
   - Conductive coating -> thickness and adhesion
   
   **Vibration & Shock Cables**:
   - Natural frequency -> mass and stiffness
   - Damping mounts -> isolation frequency
   - Resonance -> Q factor and amplification
   - Shock pulse -> G-level and duration
   - Fatigue life -> stress concentration points
   - Wire flexure -> minimum bend radius
   - Component mounting -> vibration direction
   - Potting compound -> vibration damping

10. **Lifecycle Cables** - From birth to death
   - Assembly sequence -> component placement order
   - Service interval -> replacement access design
   - End of life -> disassembly method planning
   - Regulatory compliance -> material choices (RoHS, REACH)
   - Recycling -> material marking and separation
   - Shipping -> packaging and protection design
   - Storage -> environmental condition tolerance
   - Warranty -> failure mode consideration

### Cable Coupling and Interaction Effects

**Critical Cable Interactions** - Where cables affect each other:

**Thermal-Mechanical Coupling**:
- Higher temperature -> material expansion -> stress on fasteners
- Thermal cycling -> fatigue at stress concentrations
- Hot spots -> local warping -> gasket seal compromise
- Heat stake/insert -> local material property change
- Cooling airflow -> vibration excitation possibility
- Fan mounting -> vibration transmission path

**EMI-Thermal Coupling**:
- EMI gaskets -> reduced airflow at seams
- Shielded enclosure -> no convection vents allowed
- Ferrite cores -> local heating from losses
- Cable shields -> heat conduction paths
- Conductive coatings -> thermal emissivity change

**Manufacturing-Assembly Coupling**:
- Print orientation -> support marks -> assembly face quality
- Layer direction -> snap fit strength variation
- Mold gate location -> weld lines -> weak snap fits
- Draft angles -> assembly clearance variation
- Tolerances stack -> assembly force increase

**Structural-Aesthetic Coupling**:
- Thick walls for strength -> sink marks visible
- Ribs for stiffness -> shadow lines through wall
- Boss reinforcement -> local thickness -> sink marks
- Support structure -> surface blemishes
- Parting line -> aesthetic vs functional placement

**Cable Cascade Examples**:
1. Component gets hot -> needs heatsink -> increases height -> changes airflow -> affects other components -> redesign needed
2. Add EMI shield -> blocks airflow -> temperature rises -> fan needed -> EMI leak at fan -> filter needed -> pressure drop -> bigger fan -> more noise
3. Increase wall for strength -> longer cooling time -> higher cost -> thinner wall -> add ribs -> complex mold -> higher tooling cost
4. Tight tolerance for fit -> expensive manufacturing -> open tolerance -> add gasket -> compression force -> thicker walls -> weight increase

### The Critical Insight

**Every cable is bidirectional and most are coupled.** Change the enclosure height, and you affect cooling. Improve cooling with vents, and you affect EMI shielding. Add EMI shielding, and you affect cost. But more critically, these changes cascade through coupled cables creating unexpected consequences far from the initial change.

The PDU Media Player taught us: The terminal block's wire clearance cable (25mm!) was invisible until we traced it. The relay module's true dimensions (129mm not 75mm) revealed a broken cable in our mental model. But the deepest lesson was the coupling: fixing the height with a domed lid changed thermal behavior, assembly sequence, and manufacturing cost.

**Before you design, map every cable. Before you CAD, trace every dependency. Before you change anything, follow all coupled cables. The geometry is just what's left after all the cables are satisfied and their interactions are resolved.**

### Cable Priority Resolution

When cables conflict, resolve in this order:
1. **Safety cables** (human protection, fire prevention)
2. **Regulatory cables** (EMC, environmental, certification)
3. **Functional cables** (must work as intended)
4. **Manufacturing cables** (must be buildable)
5. **Assembly cables** (must be assembleable)
6. **Service cables** (must be maintainable)
7. **Cost cables** (must be affordable)
8. **Aesthetic cables** (should look good)

## Final Words: The Philosophy of Following the Cable

This orchestration is your protection against the expensive moment of discovery when components don't fit. But more deeply, it's a fundamental shift in how you perceive design.

**You are not designing an enclosure. You are architecting a nervous system.**

Every component is a node. Every constraint is a cable. Every decision propagates through the network. The solid walls and mounting bosses you see in CAD are merely the physical manifestation of an invisible dependency graph that governs everything.

The time invested in mapping cables is not overhead - it IS the design. CAD is just rendering the topology visible.

**Remember**: 
- Requirements Interrogator reveals the hidden cables
- Checklist Architect ensures no cable is broken
- Archimedes formalizes the cable network mathematically
- DaVinci sees the complete nervous system before creating geometry
- Every failure is a missed cable
- Every success comes from complete cable tracing

**The Fundamental Truth**:
> "To ignore a cable is to plant a seed of failure.  
> To follow every cable is to guarantee success.  
> The geometry is just what remains after all cables are satisfied."

**Follow the cables, and your enclosure will work the first time.**

As the philosophy states: You are not merely building an object; you are weaving a web of consequences. The integrity of the final product depends entirely on the integrity of this web.
