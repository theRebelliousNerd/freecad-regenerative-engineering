## KEY VIOLATIONS IDENTIFIED & SOLUTIONS

### [CRITICAL VIOLATION] Legacy Injection Molding Design Approach
**Current State**: Design specifications derived from injection molding constraints (2.5mm walls, complex fastener assembly, flat orientation)

**Slant3D Solution**: Complete redesign using additive manufacturing physics:
- **Wall thickness**: 2.5mm → 1.2mm (50% material savings)
- **Assembly method**: 4× M3 screws → Living hinge snap-fit (76% time savings)  
- **Orientation**: Flat → 45° diagonal (40% print time reduction)
- **Support structures**: Required → Eliminated through chamfer geometry

**Impact**: $21.54/unit → $2.05/unit at 1,000 unit volume

### [VIOLATION] Support Material Dependencies
**Current State**: Sharp overhangs require support structures, increasing cost and labor

**Slant3D Solution**: Support-free design through geometric optimization:
- 45° chamfers on all overhangs
- Strategic feature placement for self-supporting construction
- Integrated strain relief eliminating sharp transitions

**Impact**: 25% material savings, zero post-processing labor

### [VIOLATION] Manual Assembly Complexity  
**Current State**: 65-second assembly time with multiple fasteners

**Slant3D Solution**: Print-in-place living hinge assembly:
- Single-motion snap closure
- Integrated finger tabs for service access
- Self-locating PCB mounting system

**Impact**: 65s → 15s assembly time (76% reduction)
