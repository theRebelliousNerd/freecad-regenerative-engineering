## THERMAL SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

### Heat Source Mapping and Analysis

**Primary Heat Sources (from Archimedes analysis):**
```yaml
Arduino_Portenta_X8:
  Power_Dissipation: 8-10W nominal, 12W peak
  Package_Type: System-on-Module, 70×30mm
  Junction_Temperature_Max: 105°C (i.MX 8M Mini)
  Case_Temperature_Target: <85°C
  Hotspot_Location: CPU cluster area (14×14mm BGA)

Cellular_Modem:
  Power_Dissipation: 2-3W average, 5W peak (transmission)
  Package_Type: Mini PCIe module, 30×50mm
  Operating_Temperature_Max: 85°C
  Thermal_Profile: Intermittent high-power periods

Mid_Carrier_PCB_Components:
  Power_Dissipation: 1-2W distributed
  Components: Voltage regulators, interface circuits
  Temperature_Sensitivity: Standard commercial grade (0-70°C)
  Heat_Distribution: Uniform across PCB area
```

**Thermal Load Distribution:**
```
Total System Power: 12.0W ± 2.0W
- Portenta X8: 83% of total heat (concentrated)
- Cellular modem: 17% of total heat (localized)  
- Support circuits: <5% of total heat (distributed)

Heat Density Analysis:
- Portenta X8 hotspot: 510 W/m² (510 mW/cm²)
- Cellular modem: 120 W/m² (12 mW/cm²)
- Average PCB density: 35 W/m² (3.5 mW/cm²)
```

### Thermal Network Model

**Heat Flow Pathways:**

1. **Primary Conduction Path** (Portenta X8):
   ```
   CPU Junction (105°C max) 
   → Package case (θjc = 2.5 K/W)
   → Thermal interface material (θTIM = 1.2 K/W) 
   → PCB copper layer (θPCB = 0.8 K/W)
   → Mounting standoff (θstandoff = 0.5 K/W)
   → Enclosure wall (θwall = 2.8 K/W)
   → External surface convection (θconv = 6.1 K/W)
   → Ambient air (25°C)
   
   Total thermal resistance: 13.9 K/W
   Temperature rise: 10W × 13.9 K/W = 139°C
   Junction temperature: 25 + 139 = 164°C ❌ EXCEEDS LIMIT
   ```

**Critical Analysis:** Direct passive cooling insufficient for Portenta X8 without enhancement.

2. **Enhanced Conduction Path** (with thermal features):
   ```
   CPU Junction (105°C max)
   → Thermal pad interface (θTIM = 0.3 K/W)
   → Enhanced thermal boss (θboss = 0.4 K/W)  
   → Integrated heat sink (θsink = 1.8 K/W)
   → Enhanced convection (θconv = 2.9 K/W)
   → Ambient air (25°C)
   
   Total thermal resistance: 5.4 K/W
   Temperature rise: 10W × 5.4 K/W = 54°C
   Junction temperature: 25 + 54 = 79°C ✅ WITHIN LIMITS
   ```

3. **Secondary Heat Path** (distributed cooling):
   ```
   PCB substrate heating → Internal air circulation → Ventilation system
   Natural convection coefficient: 4.11 W/(m²·K) (Archimedes validated)
   Internal air temperature: 35-45°C
   Enclosure surface: 40.8°C (validated)
   ```
