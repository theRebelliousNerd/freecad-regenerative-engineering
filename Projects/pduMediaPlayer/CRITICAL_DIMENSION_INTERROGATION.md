## 🎯 MATHEMATICAL PROOFS REQUIRED

For EACH question above, Archimedes must provide:

1. **Governing Equation**: The physics/math that rules this domain
2. **Parameter Values**: With sources and confidence intervals  
3. **Calculation**: Step-by-step derivation
4. **Result**: Numerical answer with units and uncertainty
5. **Pass/Fail Criteria**: Specific threshold for acceptance
6. **Mitigation**: If fail, what changes needed

Example format:
```
PROOF: Terminal Block Wire Clearance
Equation: h_required = h_wire_strip + r_bend × (1 - cos(θ_approach))
Parameters: 
  - h_wire_strip = 8mm ± 1mm (manufacturer spec)
  - r_bend = 5 × d_wire = 5 × 3.5mm = 17.5mm (NEC code)
  - θ_approach = 45° ± 10° (ergonomic limit)
Calculation: h_required = 8 + 17.5 × (1 - cos(45°)) = 8 + 5.1 = 13.1mm
Result: 13.1mm ± 2mm clearance required
Pass/Fail: Current 25mm > 13.1mm ✓ PASS
Confidence: 95% (Monte Carlo n=10,000)
