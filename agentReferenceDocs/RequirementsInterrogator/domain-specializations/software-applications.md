# Software Applications Interrogation

## Domain-Specific Focus

Software applications require specialized interrogation to prevent the classic failures: feature creep, performance disasters, security vulnerabilities, and user experience catastrophes. The key is extracting concrete requirements from abstract user intentions.

## The Software Application Disaster Catalog

### Disaster 1: The Performance Surprise
**Initial User Statement**: "It needs to be fast"
**Reality Discovered**: "Fast" meant <100ms response time for 10,000 concurrent users
**Cost of Failure**: Complete architecture redesign after beta, 6-month delay
**Prevention**: Quantified performance requirements with load specifications

### Disaster 2: The Feature Creep Explosion
**Initial User Statement**: "A simple task management app"
**Reality Discovered**: Wanted CRM, reporting, billing, and project management
**Cost of Failure**: 300% budget overrun, product never completed
**Prevention**: Systematic feature prioritization and scope control

### Disaster 3: The Security Afterthought Crisis
**Initial User Statement**: "Basic user login"
**Reality Discovered**: GDPR compliance, PCI requirements, audit trails needed
**Cost of Failure**: Security redesign, compliance delays, regulatory fines
**Prevention**: Early regulatory and security requirements identification

## Specialized Interrogation Protocols for Software Applications

### Phase 1: Core Purpose & Value Proposition

#### The Business Problem Deep Dive
```
STEP 1: Problem Identification
User: "I want a web app for managing projects"
Interrogator: "What specific problem are you solving that existing solutions don't address?"
- Why build vs. buy existing solutions?
- What's broken with current approaches?
- What's the cost of NOT solving this problem?

STEP 2: Success Metrics Definition
"How will you measure success for this application?"
- User adoption targets
- Performance metrics  
- Business impact measurements
- ROI expectations and timeline

STEP 3: Value Proposition Validation
"What value does this create and for whom?"
- Primary beneficiaries
- Economic value created
- Competitive advantages
- Market differentiation
```

#### Critical Business Context Questions
- "What happens if this project fails completely?"
- "Who has budget authority and what's their success criteria?"
- "How does this fit into broader business strategy?"
- "What political or organizational factors could impact requirements?"

- Acceptance criteria for completion

STEP 3: Workflow Integration
"How does this feature fit into the user's broader workflow?"
- Prerequisites and triggers
- Outputs and next steps
- Integration points with other systems

```

#### Feature Validation Questions
- "What happens if this feature doesn't exist?"
- "How is this task accomplished today without this feature?"
- "What would make this feature completely unusable?"
- "How will you know if users actually use this feature?"

STEP 3: Data Volume Planning
"How much data will this application handle?"
- Records per day/month/year
- File upload sizes and types

- Archive and purging requirements
```

#### Critical Performance Questions
- "At what response time do users abandon the task?"
- "What's the business cost of 1 second additional latency?"
- "How does performance impact user adoption?"
- "What happens during peak usage periods?"

### Phase 5: Security & Compliance Deep Dive

#### Security Requirements Interrogation
```
STEP 1: Data Classification
"What types of data will this application handle?"

STEP 3: Threat Model Development
"What are you most worried about from a security perspective?"
- Data breaches and unauthorized access
