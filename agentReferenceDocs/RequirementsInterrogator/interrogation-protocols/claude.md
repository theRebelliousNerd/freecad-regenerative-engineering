# Interrogation Protocols - Context Menu

This directory contains systematic approaches and conversation techniques for extracting complete requirements through structured dialogue. These protocols implement **cable discovery techniques** - systematically revealing the hidden dependency network within user statements.

## Cable Discovery Through Systematic Interrogation

Your interrogation protocols are designed to reveal different types of hidden cables in user requirements:

### Context Discovery (Phase 1)
- **Purpose Cables**: Connect stated features to underlying business needs
- **User Journey Cables**: Connect functional requirements to actual usage patterns
- **Environment Cables**: Connect product requirements to operational conditions
- **Constraint Discovery Cables**: Connect "simple" requests to complex technical realities

### Systematic Probing Techniques
- **Follow the Cable Backward**: From stated need to root requirement
- **Follow the Cable Forward**: From requirement to implementation consequences  
- **Follow the Cable Sideways**: From requirement to related dependencies
- **Follow the Cable Through Failure**: From requirement to failure modes

## JITC Implementation in Interrogation Process

Your interrogation follows Just-in-Time Context principles - you detect uncertainty in user responses and retrieve specific clarifying context:

**New Project Start**: Read 1 (universal protocol) then 2 (conversation patterns)
**Difficult User Interaction**: Focus on 4 (resistance management) with reference to 2
**Quality Assurance**: Focus on 3 (red flag detection)
**Technique Refinement**: Read 2 (conversation patterns) for specific dialogue methods
**Framework Implementation**: Focus on 1 (universal protocol) for systematic approach
**Problem User Statements**: Use 3 (red flag detection) for analysis and response

## Interrogation Flow Integration

These protocols implement the philosophical foundation from core-philosophy through:

- **Systematic Questioning**: Universal protocol provides structure
- **Socratic Method**: Conversation patterns implement dialogue techniques  
- **Failure Prevention**: Red flag detection catches problems early
- **Human Factors**: Resistance management maintains user cooperation

## Success Criteria for Protocol Mastery

# IMPORTANT: ALWAYS REMEMBER THAT SUBAGENTS CANNOT TALK TO EACHOTHER, OR TO THE USER! BUT CAN COMMUNICATE WITH WRITTEN MARKDOWN FILES FOR OTHER SUBAGENTS TO READ, OR BY PASSING INFORMATION TO THE MAIN AGENT TO COMMUNICATE TO OTHER SUBAGENTS OR PASS TO THE USER!


You have mastered these protocols when:

1. **Systematic Application**: Following universal protocol becomes automatic
2. **Pattern Recognition**: Identifying conversation opportunities instinctively  
3. **Red Flag Sensitivity**: Spotting problem statements immediately
4. **Resistance Navigation**: Maintaining user engagement under pressure
5. **Quality Assurance**: Producing consistently complete requirements
6. **Efficient Dialogue**: Extracting maximum information with minimum user burden

**Scenario 1 - New Physical Product**:
1. Use universal protocol Phase 1 for purpose discovery
2. Apply conversation patterns for component reality check
3. Watch for red flags around dimensional specifications
4. Manage resistance when drilling into details

**Scenario 2 - Software Application**:
1. Use universal protocol for stakeholder mapping
2. Apply workflow deep-dive conversation pattern
3. Watch for red flags around performance requirements
4. Handle resistance to detailed use case analysis

**Scenario 3 - System Integration**:
1. Use universal protocol for constraint identification
2. Apply stakeholder perspective switching pattern
3. Watch for red flags around interface requirements
4. Manage resistance from multiple stakeholder groups

If you find yourself:
- Accepting vague requirements without systematic probing
- Missing stakeholder perspectives or edge cases
- Unable to detect problem statements from users
- Losing user engagement during questioning
- Producing incomplete requirements blueprints

Return to these protocols immediately and identify which techniques need reinforcement.
