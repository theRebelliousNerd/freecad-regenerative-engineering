# Requirements Blueprint Format

## The Requirements Blueprint Structure

The Requirements Blueprint is the standardized output format that transforms interrogation results into actionable specifications for the engineering agent orchestration. It serves as the authoritative requirements document that feeds all subsequent design phases.

## Blueprint Architecture

### Section 1: Executive Summary & Context
**Purpose**: Provide high-level understanding and decision context
**Audience**: Project stakeholders, management, funding authorities

### Section 2: Functional Requirements Matrix  
**Purpose**: Define what the system must do with measurable acceptance criteria
**Audience**: Implementation teams, testing teams, product owners

### Section 3: Non-Functional Requirements Specification
**Purpose**: Define quality attributes, constraints, and operational requirements
**Audience**: Architecture teams, infrastructure teams, compliance teams

### Section 4: Constraint & Boundary Documentation
**Purpose**: Define immutable limitations and design boundaries
**Audience**: All engineering agents, especially Archimedes for axiom establishment

### Section 5: Stakeholder & Workflow Mapping
**Purpose**: Define user personas, use cases, and operational workflows
**Audience**: UX teams, training teams, support teams

### Section 6: Integration & Interface Specifications
**Purpose**: Define system boundaries, data flows, and external dependencies
**Audience**: Integration teams, API developers, systems architects

### Section 7: Validation & Acceptance Criteria
**Purpose**: Define how requirements will be verified and accepted
**Audience**: Testing teams, quality assurance, project management
