# Safety Checklists - Human Protection Cable Network

## Overview: Safety as Unbreakable Human Protection Cables
Safety checklists create inviolable quality assurance cables that protect human life and wellbeing. These are "life-critical cables" that can never be compromised, overridden, or deprioritized - they represent the absolute priority network in any engineering system.

## Just-in-Time Context Access
Load safety checklists when:
- **Human interaction** with system (any contact, proximity, or exposure)
- **Safety-critical applications** (medical, transportation, industrial)
- **Regulatory compliance** required (FDA, FAA, OSHA, CE marking)
- **Hazardous materials/energy** present (electrical, mechanical, chemical, thermal)
- **Failure consequences** could harm humans

### Safety Cables as Life Protection Systems
Safety checklists create "life-critical cables" with special properties:
- **Unbreakable Priority**: Safety cables always take precedence over performance, cost, or schedule
- **Redundant Validation**: Critical safety paths have backup verification cables
- **Fail-Safe Design**: Cable breaks must fail to safe states, never unsafe states
- **Human-Centric**: All cables evaluated from human safety perspective first

### Primary Safety Cable Categories

#### Hazard Identification Cables
**Function**: Systematically identify all potential human hazards
**Network Location**: System Design → Hazard Analysis
**When Critical**: Initial design, design changes, new applications

**Critical Hazard Types**:
- Electrical hazards (shock, electrocution, fire)
- Mechanical hazards (crushing, cutting, impact, entanglement)
- Thermal hazards (burns, scalding, freezing)
- Chemical hazards (toxicity, corrosion, explosion)
- Radiation hazards (electromagnetic, ionizing, optical)

#### Risk Assessment Cables
**Function**: Quantify hazard severity and likelihood
**Network Location**: Hazard Identification → Risk Quantification
**When Critical**: After hazard identification, for risk prioritization

**Risk Assessment Framework**:
```
Severity × Likelihood = Risk Level
- Catastrophic (Death/Permanent Disability) × High Likelihood = UNACCEPTABLE
- Critical (Serious Injury) × Medium Likelihood = HIGH RISK
- Marginal (Minor Injury) × Low Likelihood = ACCEPTABLE with mitigation
```

#### Safety Design Integration Cables
**Function**: Integrate safety requirements into system design
**Network Location**: Risk Assessment → Design Requirements
**When Critical**: Throughout design process, not as afterthought

**Safety Design Hierarchy**:
1. **Eliminate hazards** (design out the hazard entirely)
2. **Reduce risks** (guard, shield, isolate hazards)
3. **Warning systems** (alert users to residual hazards)
4. **Protective equipment** (PPE as last resort)

### Integration with Vitruvius Human Factors Agent

#### Vitruvius Safety Coordination
Safety checklists coordinate with Vitruvius (Human Factors Expert):

```

Vitruvius Human Safety Assessment
    ↓ (safety requirement cable)
Safety-Integrated Design Requirements
    ↓ (safety validation cable)
Human-Safe System Design
```

### Safety Network Failure Prevention

#### Safety Cable Break Patterns

**"Safety Last" Anti-Pattern**:
- **Symptom**: Safety considered after design completion
- **Cable Break**: Design → Safety validation gap
- **Prevention**: Safety cables integrated from project inception

**"Acceptable Risk" Rationalization Pattern**:
- **Symptom**: Human safety compromised for performance/cost
- **Cable Break**: Safety priority → Performance priority inversion
- **Prevention**: Unbreakable safety priority cables

### Safety Gate Integration

#### Safety-Critical Gate Criteria
For safety-critical systems, ALL gates include mandatory safety validation:

**Gate 0 Safety Requirements**:
- Hazard identification: COMPLETE
- Safety requirements: DEFINED
- Regulatory requirements: IDENTIFIED
- Safety responsibility: ASSIGNED

**Gate 1 Safety Requirements**:
- Safety design integration: IMPLEMENTED
- Hazard mitigation: DESIGNED
- Safety testing plan: DEFINED

**Gate 3 Safety Requirements**:
- Safety validation: COMPLETE
- Risk assessment: ACCEPTABLE
- Regulatory compliance: VERIFIED

**Gate 4 Safety Requirements**:
- Safety documentation: COMPLETE
- User safety instructions: VALIDATED
- Safety monitoring: IMPLEMENTED

### Safety Network Priority Protocol

#### Safety Override Authority
Safety cables have absolute override authority:

```python
def safety_override_check(design_decision, safety_assessment):
    if safety_assessment.risk_level == "UNACCEPTABLE":
        return {
            "decision": "REJECTED",
            "reason": "UNACCEPTABLE HUMAN SAFETY RISK",
            "override_authority": "SAFETY_ABSOLUTE_PRIORITY",
            "required_action": "REDESIGN_TO_ELIMINATE_HAZARD"
        }
    
    return {"decision": "CONDITIONAL_APPROVAL", "safety_monitoring": "REQUIRED"}
```

#### Human Safety Validation Protocol
```
Protocol: Human Safety Validation (HSV)
Version: 1.0
Priority: ABSOLUTE_MAXIMUM

Validation Sequence:
1. Hazard Identification: Systematic analysis of all potential human hazards
2. Risk Assessment: Quantification of hazard severity and likelihood  
3. Safety Design: Integration of safety requirements into system design
4. Safety Testing: Validation that safety measures work as intended
5. Human Validation: Testing with actual humans under realistic conditions
6. Safety Documentation: Complete user safety instructions and warnings

Failure Response:
- ANY safety validation failure = IMMEDIATE PROJECT STOP
- NO exceptions for schedule, budget, or performance pressure
- Redesign required to eliminate unacceptable human safety risks
```

Remember: **Safety checklists create life-critical cables that can never be broken or compromised. Human safety is not negotiable - it's the foundational constraint that all other design decisions must respect. Safety cables have absolute priority in the quality network because human life and wellbeing are more valuable than any project outcome.**
