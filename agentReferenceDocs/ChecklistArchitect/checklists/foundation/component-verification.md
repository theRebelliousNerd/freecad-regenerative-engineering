# Foundation Checklist: Component Verification
*The Critical Foundation for Preventing Component Surprise*

**Checklist ID**: FC-001  
**Version**: 2.1.0  
**Phase**: Gate 1 - Pre-CAD Checkpoint  
**Criticality**: CRITICAL  
**Estimated Duration**: 15-45 minutes per component  
**Prerequisites**: Requirements Blueprint complete, components identified

## Purpose
Ensure every physical component is completely characterized before any geometric modeling begins. This checklist has prevented more project failures than any other single intervention.

## The Golden Rule
**"NO CAD UNTIL EVERY COMPONENT IS REAL AND VERIFIED"**

## Quality Control and Verification

### Verification Hierarchy Standards
1. **GOLD STANDARD**: Physical measurement of actual component

   - Confidence Level: HIGH
   - Accuracy: ±0.5mm or better

2. **ACCEPTABLE**: Manufacturer datasheet with verified part number  
   - Required for: Standard components with reliable suppliers
   - Confidence Level: MEDIUM
   - Must include: Part number verification, datasheet date

3. **CONDITIONAL**: Engineering drawing with confirmation plan
   - Allowed for: Components on order with verified specifications
   - Confidence Level: LOW
   - Must include: Delivery confirmation plan, backup suppliers

4. **UNACCEPTABLE**: Estimates, approximations, or "about" values
   - NEVER ACCEPTABLE for any component
   - Automatic Gate 1 failure
   - Must be resolved before CAD work can begin

### Cross-Verification Requirements
For components >$100 value or critical to function:
- [ ] **Two independent measurements/verifications**
- [ ] **Datasheet cross-check with physical measurement**
- [ ] **Peer review of component database entry**

### Database Completeness Check
Before declaring component verification complete:
- [ ] **All functional requirements have associated physical components**
- [ ] **All components have complete database entries**  
- [ ] **No components marked as "estimated" or "approximate"**

### Conditional Pass (With Risk Mitigation)
If 90-99% complete with justification:
