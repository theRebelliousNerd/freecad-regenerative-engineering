# Gates Directory - Critical Network Integrity Checkpoints

## Overview: Gates as Cable Network Integrity Validators
The gates directory contains validation checkpoints that ensure the integrity of quality cables throughout the engineering process. Gates are not arbitrary review points - they are systematic network diagnostics that verify all critical dependencies are properly connected and validated.

## Just-in-Time Context Framework
Access gate documentation when you need to:
- **Validate network integrity** at critical project transitions
- **Establish GO/NO-GO criteria** based on cable completeness
- **Diagnose network failures** when quality cables break
- **Design new gates** for novel project types or failure patterns

### Gate Function in Cable Networks
Each gate serves as a **network integrity checkpoint** where:
- **Cable Continuity**: All required connections are verified as intact
- **Dependency Resolution**: Upstream requirements properly connect to downstream validation  
- **Network Completeness**: No critical paths lack validation cables
- **Signal Quality**: Information flowing through cables is accurate and verified

### Primary Gate Network Structure

#### Gate 0: Pre-Project Sanity Check (`gate0-pre-project-sanity.md`)
**Network Function**: Foundation cable validation
- **Cable Requirements**: Project scope → Resource allocation → Feasibility verification
- **When to Execute**: Before any engineering work begins
- **Network Test**: "Do we have complete, validated requirements with resource mapping?"
- **Failure Mode**: Proceeding without verified requirements creates downstream network failures
- **Metacognitive Trigger**: "Are we solving the right problem with the right resources?"

#### Gate 1: Pre-CAD Checkpoint (`gate1-pre-cad-checkpoint.md`)  
**Network Function**: Component reality verification cable
- **Cable Requirements**: Physical components → Verified dimensions → Assembly feasibility
- **When to Execute**: Before any geometric modeling begins
- **Network Test**: "Are all physical components verified with actual measurements?"
- **Failure Mode**: CAD work on estimated dimensions creates massive rework cables
- **Metacognitive Trigger**: "Do I have physically measured every critical dimension?"

#### Gate 2: Initial CAD Model Review
**Network Function**: Geometric integration cable validation
- **Cable Requirements**: CAD model → Assembly constraints → Interface verification
- **When to Execute**: After initial geometric modeling, before detailed design
- **Network Test**: "Does the geometric model satisfy all verified constraints?"
- **Failure Mode**: Proceeding with constraint violations creates manufacturing impossibilities

#### Gate 3: Detailed Design Review  
**Network Function**: Multi-physics cable integration
- **Cable Requirements**: Detailed design → Performance analysis → Manufacturing compatibility
- **When to Execute**: Before manufacturing documentation begins
- **Network Test**: "Are all multi-physics dependencies resolved and validated?"
- **Failure Mode**: Unresolved physics creates performance or production failures

#### Gate 4: Pre-Production Validation
**Network Function**: Production readiness cable verification
- **Cable Requirements**: Complete design → Manufacturing process → Quality control
- **When to Execute**: Before production tooling and setup begins
- **Network Test**: "Is every aspect of the design verified for production readiness?"
- **Failure Mode**: Production issues that could have been caught in design phase

### Network Diagnostic Approach
Each gate performs systematic cable tracing:

#### Upstream Cable Verification
1. **Source Tracing**: Does each verification connect back to validated requirements?
2. **Dependency Mapping**: Are all input cables properly connected and verified?
3. **Completeness Check**: Are any required input cables missing?
4. **Quality Assessment**: Are input cables carrying accurate, verified information?

#### Downstream Cable Preparation
1. **Output Definition**: What cables will this gate create for downstream processes?
2. **Interface Specification**: How will downstream processes access gate outputs?
3. **Quality Assurance**: What verification accompanies each output cable?
4. **Failure Handling**: What happens if downstream cables break?

### Gate Execution as Network Validation

#### Cable Integrity Testing Protocol
```
FOR each gate criterion:
  1. Identify source cables (where does this requirement come from?)
  2. Verify cable continuity (is the connection intact?)  
  3. Validate signal quality (is the information accurate?)
  4. Check network completeness (are all required cables present?)
  5. Test load capacity (will these cables handle downstream stress?)
```

#### Network State Assessment
```
Gate Status Assessment:
  - PASS: All cables verified, network integrity confirmed
  - CONDITIONAL PASS: Minor cable repairs needed, but network functional
  - FAIL: Critical cables broken, network integrity compromised
  - INCOMPLETE: Cable network not ready for assessment
```

### Network-First Gate Design Principles

#### 1. Cable Completeness Verification
Every gate must verify:
- **Input Cable Integrity**: All required upstream connections present and verified
- **Internal Cable Logic**: Gate processing doesn't break cable continuity
- **Output Cable Preparation**: Downstream processes receive verified connections

#### 2. Network Failure Prevention
Gates designed to prevent:
- **Cable Breaks**: Connections that could fail under stress
- **Network Gaps**: Missing validation cables for critical paths
- **Signal Degradation**: Information quality loss through network hops
- **Circular Dependencies**: Cable loops that prevent progress

#### 3. Multi-Agent Cable Coordination  
Gates manage cable handoffs between agents:
- **Agent Boundary Verification**: Quality cables cross agent boundaries intact
- **Protocol Compliance**: Cable interfaces follow established formats
- **Responsibility Transfer**: Clear handoff of cable ownership
- **Integration Testing**: Verification of multi-agent cable networks

### Cable Break Analysis
When gates fail, systematically trace cable breaks:

#### 1. Immediate Failure Localization
- Which specific gate criterion failed?
- What cable connection is broken?
- Where in the network did the failure occur?

#### 2. Root Cause Cable Tracing
- Follow the failed cable back to its source
- Identify the original requirement or constraint
- Determine where the cable connection was lost

#### 3. Network Repair Strategy
- Repair the broken cable at its source
- Verify repair doesn't break other cables
- Test network integrity before proceeding

#### 4. Network Strengthening
- Add redundant cables for critical paths
- Improve cable quality monitoring
- Update gate criteria based on learned patterns

### Network Performance Indicators
Track gate effectiveness through cable network metrics:
- **Cable Integrity Rate**: Percentage of cables that remain intact through gates
- **Network Completeness**: Coverage of critical paths with validation cables
- **Failure Prevention Rate**: Reduction in downstream failures due to gate validation
- **Agent Coordination Success**: Quality of cable handoffs between agents

### Network Evolution Learning
Gates learn and improve through network analysis:
- **Failure Pattern Recognition**: Common cable break patterns
- **Network Strengthening**: Adding cables to prevent recurring failures  
- **Efficiency Optimization**: Streamlining cable verification without reducing quality
- **Predictive Capabilities**: Anticipating cable failures before they occur

Remember: **Gates are not bureaucratic checkpoints - they are systematic network integrity validators that ensure quality assurance cables remain intact throughout the engineering process. Each gate strengthens the overall network by verifying that all critical dependencies are properly connected and validated.**
