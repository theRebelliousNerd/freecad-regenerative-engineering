# Gate 1: Pre-CAD Design Checkpoint
*MANDATORY STOP Before Any Geometric Modeling*

**Version**: 1.1.0  
**Phase**: Pre-Design  
**Criticality**: CRITICAL  
**Estimated Duration**: 45-90 minutes  
**Prerequisites**: Gate 0 passed, Requirements Blueprint complete  
**Decision Authority**: Technical Lead + Archimedes

## Purpose
**PREVENT THE #1 ENGINEERING DISASTER**: Starting CAD work with incomplete information. This gate has prevented more project failures than any other single intervention. Every minute spent here saves hours of rework.

## The Golden Rule
**"NO CAD UNTIL COMPONENTS ARE REAL"**

## Participants
- **Archimedes** (PRIMARY - Component verification and mathematical validation)
- **Requirements Interrogator** (Requirements traceability)
- **Relevant Domain Specialists** (Based on project triggers)
- **Manufacturing Lead** (Production method confirmation)

## Gate Criteria
**ABSOLUTE RULE**: If ANY component dimension is unknown, estimated, or "approximately", CAD work CANNOT begin.
**Pass Threshold**: 100% component verification + all critical items pass
**Estimated Savings**: $5,000 - $50,000 in prevented rework per project

## The Component Database Requirement

Every project MUST have a verified component database before CAD begins:

### Database Structure
```yaml
component_database:
  pcb_main:
    verified: true
    method: "physical_measurement"  
    dimensions:
      length: 114.0 Â± 0.5 mm
      width: 86.5 Â± 0.5 mm  
      height: 1.6 Â± 0.1 mm
    mounting:
      hole_pattern: "4 holes, 3mm diameter"
      hole_spacing: "verified from datasheet"
    connectors:
      power: "2.54mm terminal block, top side, north edge"
      data: "USB-C, south edge, center"
    photo: "pcb_main_20240901.jpg"
    datasheet: "manufacturer_spec_v2.1.pdf"
```

### Verification Levels
1. **GOLD STANDARD**: Physical measurement of actual component
2. **ACCEPTABLE**: Manufacturer datasheet with verified part number
3. **CONDITIONAL**: Engineering drawing from reliable source with confirmation plan
4. **UNACCEPTABLE**: Estimates, approximations, or "about" values

## Decision Matrix

### Critical Item Analysis
**MANDATORY PASS ITEMS** (Gate fails if any of these fail):
- Every component physically verified OR from datasheet
- Assembly sequence validated
- No mathematical contradictions in constraints
- Manufacturing method confirmed compatible

### Scoring System
| Category | Critical Items | Weight |
|----------|---------------|--------|
| Component Verification | 7 | 40% |  
| Mathematical Foundation | 5 | 25% |
| Assembly Sequence | 3 | 20% |
| Manufacturing Method | 3 | 10% |
| Requirements Traceability | 2 | 5% |

**Pass Threshold**: 100% of critical items + 85% overall score

## GO/NO-GO Decision Process

### Automatic NO-GO Triggers
- Any component dimension is estimated or "approximately"
- Any component has not been physically verified or datasheet confirmed
- Assembly sequence has not been validated
- Mathematical constraints are contradictory
- Manufacturing method is not confirmed

### GO Conditions
- Component database 100% complete with verified dimensions
- Assembly sequence validated and documented
- All mathematical constraints consistent
- Manufacturing method selected and confirmed compatible
- All critical items pass

### The "Pencil Test"
Before GO decision: Can you build this project with pencil, paper, and verified components? If not, you're not ready for CAD.

## Historical Success Stories

### The PDU Media Player Enclosure Recovery
**Initial Failure**: Started CAD with "about 80mm" PCB dimension  
**Reality**: PCB was actually 114mm Ã 86.5mm  
**Impact**: Near-complete redesign required  
**Prevention**: This gate now prevents all "Component Surprise" failures  
**ROI**: Gate 1 process now saves 20-40 hours per enclosure project

### The Relay Module Discovery  
**Assumption**: Terminal block was "about 75mm Ã 55mm"  
**Reality**: 129mm Ã 72mm with 25mm wire clearance above  
**Impact**: Enclosure height completely wrong  
**Prevention**: Component verification now includes clearance analysis  
**ROI**: Prevented $8,000 in prototype and tooling costs

## The Gate 1 Mantra
**"Measure twice, model once, build successfully."**

Remember: Every hour spent in Gate 1 saves 10 hours of CAD rework and 100 hours of physical redesign.
