# Gate 0: Pre-Project Sanity Check
*Critical Go/No-Go Decision Point Before Resource Commitment*

**Version**: 1.0.0  
**Phase**: Project Initiation  
**Criticality**: CRITICAL  
**Estimated Duration**: 30-60 minutes  
**Prerequisites**: Initial project concept defined  
**Decision Authority**: Project Lead + Technical Lead

## Purpose
Prevent project initiation when fundamental prerequisites are missing or when success is mathematically impossible. This gate saves 100-1000x the cost of discovering problems in later phases.

## Participants
- **Requirements Interrogator** (Primary - requirements completeness)
- **Archimedes** (Mathematical feasibility) 
- **Carson** (Planetary boundary assessment)
- **Project Stakeholders** (Resource authorization)
- **Domain Specialists** (As triggered by project type)

## Gate Criteria
**PASS Threshold**: All CRITICAL items must pass. NO-GO if any critical item fails.
**Estimated Failure Cost if Gate Skipped**: $10,000 - $100,000+ in rework

## Historical Failure Modes Prevented by Gate 0

### "The Component That Doesn't Exist"
**Symptom**: Project designed around assumed component that isn't commercially available  
**Prevention**: Component availability verification required  
**Cost Impact**: Prevented $50K+ redesigns multiple times

### "The Physics Violation"  
**Symptom**: Project requires energy/power/efficiency beyond thermodynamic limits  
**Prevention**: Mathematical feasibility analysis required  
**Cost Impact**: Prevented impossible perpetual motion projects

### "The Scope Creep Monster"
**Symptom**: Requirements keep expanding because they were never properly defined  
**Prevention**: Requirements Blueprint with stakeholder sign-off required  
**Cost Impact**: Prevented 200%+ budget overruns

### "The Regulatory Surprise"
**Symptom**: Discover regulatory requirements late that require redesign  
**Prevention**: Non-functional requirements analysis includes regulatory scan  
**Cost Impact**: Prevented 6+ month delays and major redesigns

Remember: Gate 0 failures are learning opportunities. Gate 4 failures are disasters.
