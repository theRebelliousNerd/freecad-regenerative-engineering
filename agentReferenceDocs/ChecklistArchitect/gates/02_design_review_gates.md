# Design Review Gates
*Systematic Design Validation at Critical Decision Points*

## Overview

Design review gates provide systematic validation of engineering designs at key decision points throughout the design process. These gates ensure design quality, completeness, and readiness for the next phase of development.

## Design Review Philosophy

### Design Quality Through Systematic Review
High-quality designs result from systematic review and validation, not individual genius. Multiple perspectives and systematic evaluation produce better designs than individual effort alone.

### Early Problem Detection
Design problems are exponentially more expensive to fix as development progresses. Design review gates catch problems when they're least expensive to correct.

### Stakeholder Alignment
Design reviews ensure all stakeholders understand and approve design decisions before significant resources are committed to implementation.

- System architecture complete and interfaces defined
- No major technical risks unresolved
- Manufacturing feasibility confirmed at conceptual level
- All stakeholders understand and approve design direction

### Gate 3: Detailed Design Review  
**Purpose**: Validate detailed design before manufacturing preparation  
**Timing**: After detailed design complete, before manufacturing preparation begins  
**Duration**: 4-8 hours depending on complexity  
**Decision**: Proceed to manufacturing preparation, modify design, or major redesign

#### Review Scope
- **Design Completeness**: All design elements fully specified and documented
- **Performance Validation**: Design meets all performance requirements with margin

            'independent_verification': 'mandatory',
            'prototype_validation': 'required'
        }
    elif design_risk_assessment.overall_risk == "MEDIUM":
        return {
            'review_duration': 'standard',
            'additional_experts': 'recommended',
            'independent_verification': 'recommended',
            'prototype_validation': 'recommended'
        }
    else:
        return {
            'review_duration': 'expedited',
            'additional_experts': 'optional',
            'independent_verification': 'optional',
            'prototype_validation': 'optional'
        }
```

## Integration with Agent Orchestration

### Agent Participation in Design Reviews

#### Gate 2 Agent Roles
- **DaVinci**: Overall design vision and aesthetic evaluation
- **Archimedes**: Mathematical and physical feasibility validation
- **Domain Specialists**: Technical feasibility in their areas
- **Gabe**: Manufacturing feasibility assessment
- **Vitruvius**: Human factors and safety preliminary assessment

#### Gate 3 Agent Roles

- **Vitruvius**: Complete safety and human factors validation
- **Orville**: Test planning and validation strategy review

### Agent Conflict Resolution in Reviews
When agents have conflicting assessments:
1. **Technical Conflicts**: Additional analysis or testing to resolve
2. **Trade-off Conflicts**: Multi-objective optimization to find best compromise
3. **Risk Conflicts**: Conservative approach wins unless explicitly overridden
4. **Resource Conflicts**: Business stakeholders make final resource allocation decisions

## Conclusion

Design review gates provide systematic validation that ensures design quality and stakeholder alignment before significant resource commitments. By implementing rigorous design reviews, teams prevent costly design errors and ensure designs meet all requirements.

The key insight is that design reviews are not just technical validations but comprehensive stakeholder alignment processes. Good design reviews ensure everyone understands and approves the design direction before major resource commitments.

**Remember**: The cost of a thorough design review is minimal compared to the cost of fixing design problems discovered during manufacturing or in the field. Invest in systematic design validation to enable confident progression to manufacturing.
