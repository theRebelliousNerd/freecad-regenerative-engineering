# Integration - Agent Coordination Network Cables

## Directory Purpose
This directory contains protocols for coordinating with other agents in the engineering swarm. These files define the **coordination cables** that connect Orville's empirical validation network to the broader agent ecosystem, ensuring validated data flows seamlessly between theoretical and practical domains.

## Mental Model Integration

### Network View: Agent Coordination as Communication Cables
Integration creates the **inter-agent communication network**:
- **Validation Handoffs** = Data cables carrying empirical results between agents
- **Requirement Flows** = Control cables transmitting testing needs from other agents
- **Feedback Loops** = Bidirectional cables enabling iterative design refinement
- **Conflict Resolution** = Priority cables resolving validation vs. design tensions
- **Status Updates** = Information cables keeping agent network synchronized

### Follow the Cable Principle
Agent coordination traces through validation dependency cables:
```
Archimedes Math → Orville Test Request → Validation Protocol → Measured Data → Design Update → Brunel Structure
```

The cable reveals agent interdependencies:
```
DaVinci Vision → Test Requirements → Orville Protocols → Validation Results → Khan Optimization → Gabe Manufacturing
```

### Immediate Access Triggers

**READ agent_coordination_protocols.md WHEN:**
- Any agent requests validation of their work
- Conflicts arise between theoretical and empirical results
- Design iterations require re-testing
- Multi-agent project phases transition
- Validation results need propagation to other agents

### Metacognitive Agent Interaction Triggers

**High-Priority Context Retrieval:**
- Another agent proposes unvalidated parameters
- Theoretical models diverge from test results
- Design decisions need empirical backing
- Control system requires feedback data
- Manufacturing constraints conflict with test results

**JITC Agent Confidence Thresholds:**
- Agent disagreement detected → Load conflict resolution protocols
- New agent enters validation workflow → Load handoff procedures  
- Validation bottleneck identified → Load priority management protocols

### Inbound Agent Dependencies (What Other Agents Need From Orville)
- **Archimedes** needs empirical validation of mathematical predictions
- **DaVinci** needs feasibility testing of conceptual designs
- **Brunel** needs performance validation of integrated systems  
- **Khan** needs experimental data for optimization constraints
- **Gabe** needs quality validation of manufacturing processes
- **Tesla/Edison/Hertz** need component validation and integration testing

### Outbound Agent Dependencies (What Orville Needs From Other Agents)
- **Clear test requirements** with measurable success criteria
- **Component specifications** with tolerances and operating ranges
- **Design models** for comparison with empirical results
- **Priority guidance** when validation conflicts arise
- **Feedback interpretation** for design iteration guidance

### Protocol Selection Based on Agent Type

**For Mathematical Agents (Archimedes, Khan):**
- Use statistical validation protocols
- Provide uncertainty bounds and confidence intervals
- Focus on quantitative comparison with predictions

**For Design Agents (DaVinci, Brunel):**
- Use performance validation protocols  
- Provide actionable feedback for design iteration
- Focus on constraint identification and feasibility assessment

**For Manufacturing Agents (Gabe, Edison):**
- Use quality validation protocols
- Provide process capability and yield data
- Focus on production feasibility and repeatability

### Critical Cable Maintenance

**Cable Health Monitoring:**
- Track validation response times to agent requests
- Monitor conflict resolution effectiveness
- Measure design iteration convergence rates
- Assess agent satisfaction with validation quality

**Cable Failure Prevention:**
- Establish clear validation criteria before testing
- Maintain agent communication protocols
- Document all validation decisions and rationale
- Ensure timely feedback to requesting agents

### Context Compression Strategies
- Cache active validation protocols for current project phase
- Maintain priority agent communication channels
- Keep conflict resolution procedures immediately accessible

### Context Expansion Triggers
- New agent type joins project → Load relevant coordination protocols
- Project phase transition → Update agent priority and communication patterns
- Validation conflict detected → Expand conflict resolution context

### Context Pruning Protocols
- Archive completed validation results with agent handoff confirmation
- Remove outdated agent status once design phase transitions
- Maintain only active agent coordination protocols

**Integration Philosophy**: Orville serves as the **empirical ground truth node** in the agent network. All theoretical cables from other agents must pass through Orville's validation network before becoming trusted design inputs. This creates a **validation-centric agent architecture** where empirical evidence arbitrates all design decisions.

Remember: These integration protocols are the **trust cables** that ensure the entire agent network operates from validated, empirically-grounded information rather than theoretical assumptions.
