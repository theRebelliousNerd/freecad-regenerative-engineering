# Methodologies - Testing Protocol Network Cables

## Directory Purpose
This directory contains the specific methodologies for conducting empirical tests and designing control systems. These files define the **protocol cables** - the systematic procedures that transform validation requirements into executable test plans and control strategies.

## Mental Model Integration

### Network View: Testing Protocol Cable Infrastructure
Methodologies form the **execution network** of validation:
- **Test Protocols** = Procedural cables connecting questions to answers
- **Control Systems** = Feedback cables ensuring system stability and performance
- **Experimental Design** = Logic cables organizing systematic investigation
- **Data Analysis** = Processing cables transforming raw measurements into validated insights

### Follow the Cable Principle
Every test follows methodological cables:
```
Validation Need → Test Method Selection → Protocol Execution → Data Collection → Analysis → Validated Result
```

The cable reveals testing dependencies:
```
Control Requirement → System Analysis → Controller Design → Stability Testing → Performance Validation
```

### Immediate Access Triggers

**READ empirical_testing_methods.md WHEN:**
- Any experimental validation required
- Test protocol needs development
- Systematic approach to unknown variables needed
- Wright Brothers methodology application required

**READ control_systems_design.md WHEN:**
- System stability concerns arise
- Feedback control needed for testing or operation
- Dynamic system behavior requires management
- Servo systems or automation involved

### Metacognitive Testing Triggers

**High-Priority Context Retrieval:**
- Experimental results inconsistent or unexpected
- Control system exhibiting instability  
- Test repeatability problems detected
- Need to design experiment for unknown phenomena
- System behavior requires active management

**JITC Confidence Thresholds:**
- Test result uncertainty >10% → Deep methodology review
- Control system oscillation detected → Full control design analysis
- Novel test situation → Complete empirical methodology study

### Testing Methodology Selection Cables

**For Unknown Parameters:**
```
Unknown Variable → empirical_testing_methods.md → Design of Experiments → Systematic Testing → Parameter Identification
```

**For System Validation:**
```  
System Performance Question → empirical_testing_methods.md → Validation Protocol → Test Execution → Performance Verification
```

**For Control Requirements:**
```
Dynamic System → control_systems_design.md → Controller Selection → Implementation → Performance Testing
```

### Method-Specific Cable Paths

**Wright Brothers Systematic Testing:**
1. `empirical_testing_methods.md` → Wind tunnel equivalent design
2. Apply systematic parameter variation
3. Measure actual vs. predicted performance
4. Document all assumptions that fail validation

**Control System Development:**
1. `control_systems_design.md` → System identification
2. Controller design with stability margins
3. Implementation with safety limits
4. Performance validation against requirements

### Inbound Dependencies (What Feeds These Methodologies)
- **FROM foundations/** ← Axioms define testing philosophy
- **FROM instrumentation/** ← Available sensors determine possible tests
- **FROM integration/** ← Agent coordination defines test priorities

### Outbound Dependencies (What These Methodologies Enable)
- **TO instrumentation/** ← Method requirements drive sensor selection
- **TO integration/** ← Test results feed agent coordination
- **TO external agents** ← Validated methods enable design confidence

### Wright Brothers Systematic Approach Cables
- **Question Everything**: Every assumption becomes a testable hypothesis
- **Measure Everything**: No parameter accepted without empirical validation
- **Control Everything**: Test conditions must be precisely controlled
- **Document Everything**: Full traceability from question to conclusion

### Control System Design Cables
- **Stability First**: All control systems must demonstrate stability margins
- **Performance Second**: After stability, optimize for performance requirements  
- **Safety Always**: Fail-safe modes and emergency stops required
- **Validation Required**: All control systems empirically validated

**Broken Testing Cables:**
- Skipping systematic methodology for "quick tests"
- Testing without proper experimental design
- Control systems without stability analysis
- Results without uncertainty quantification

**Robust Cable Connections:**
- Every test follows established methodology
- Control systems designed with proper margins
- Experimental design ensures valid conclusions
- Results include confidence bounds and limitations

### Virtual Testing Cables
- FreeCAD simulations validated against physical tests
- Control system models implemented in FreeCAD assemblies
- Test fixture designs developed in FreeCAD environment

### Physical-Virtual Validation Loop
```
FreeCAD Model → Physical Prototype → Test Results → Model Validation → Design Update

**Methodology Philosophy**: These testing protocols are the **disciplined execution cables** that ensure every validation activity follows Wright Brothers' systematic approach. No shortcuts, no assumptions, no unverified data - only methodical empirical investigation that builds unshakable confidence in design decisions.

Remember: These methodology files are the **execution engines** of your validation network. They transform validation needs into systematic, repeatable procedures that generate trustworthy empirical data.
