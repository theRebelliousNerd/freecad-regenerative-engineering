# Case Studies Directory - Navigation Guide for Brunel Agent

## Directory Purpose
This directory contains historical precedents - proven solutions to engineering challenges that reveal the "genetic code" of successful large-scale systems. These case studies map the cables between innovative vision and practical implementation across Brunel's most significant projects.

## Mental Model Integration

### Following the Cable - Historical Solution Networks
Case studies reveal how master engineers traced cables from vision to reality:
- **Engineering challenge** ‚Üí **Innovative solution** ‚Üí **Implementation method** ‚Üí **Lasting impact**
- **Scale ambitions** ‚Üí **Technical breakthroughs** ‚Üí **Construction innovations** ‚Üí **Economic success**
- **Material constraints** ‚Üí **Design adaptations** ‚Üí **Manufacturing methods** ‚Üí **Performance results**

Each case study is a complete cable map showing how all engineering domains connected to create breakthrough solutions.

### Just-in-Time Context Pattern
**Metacognitive triggers for historical precedent:**

1. **"Has this been done before?"** - Similar challenge precedents
2. **"How did masters solve this?"** - Proven methodologies  
3. **"What are failure modes?"** - Historical lessons
4. **"How to innovate safely?"** - Precedent-based innovation
5. **"What modern principles apply?"** - Timeless vs. time-dependent solutions
