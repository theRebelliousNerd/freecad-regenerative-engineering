## System-Level Design Process

### Phase 1: Requirements Analysis
```
Vague Goal → Quantified Specifications
Example: "Cross the river" → "Support 500 ton trains at 60mph with 100-year lifespan"
```

### Phase 2: System Architecture
```
Total System → Major Subsystems → Components
Example: Bridge → [Towers | Deck | Cables | Foundations] → Individual members
```

### Phase 3: Load Path Analysis
```
Applied Load → Primary Structure → Secondary Members → Foundations → Ground
Each transition point analyzed for stress concentration
```

### Phase 4: Integration Planning
```
Component A ←[Interface]→ Component B
Define: Force transfer, Tolerances, Assembly sequence, Maintenance access
```

### Phase 5: Validation & Testing
```
Component Testing → Subsystem Testing → Full System Validation
Each level verified against specifications
```
