## Mathematical Framework

### System Reliability
```
R_system = R_1 × R_2 × ... × R_n  (Series system)
R_system = 1 - (1-R_1) × (1-R_2) × ... × (1-R_n)  (Parallel system)
```

### Load Distribution
```
Total Load = Σ Component Loads
Stress Concentration Factor = Local Stress / Nominal Stress
System FOS = min(Component FOS values)
```

### Scale Effects
```
Volume ∝ L³
Surface Area ∝ L²
Strength ∝ L² (for similar materials)
Critical Scale = point where material change required
```

## Conclusion

Brunel's systems engineering approach remains relevant today. His methods of decomposition, integration, and validation provide a framework for tackling complex engineering challenges. The key insight - that the whole system must be considered, not just individual parts - continues to guide modern engineering practice.

In FreeCAD assemblies, this translates to:
- Clear hierarchy and organization
- Explicit constraint definition
- Complete load path analysis
- Rigorous validation at each level
- Documentation of critical interfaces

The legacy of Brunel's systematic approach lives on in every well-engineered assembly that transforms a concept into reality.
