## Best Practices

### Assembly Design Guidelines

1. **Accessibility**: Ensure all connection points can be reached
2. **Standardization**: Use common fasteners and interfaces
3. **Modularity**: Design in logical, testable subassemblies
4. **Tolerance**: Build in adjustment capability
5. **Documentation**: Clear assembly instructions and diagrams
6. **Safety**: Design for safe assembly procedures
7. **Maintenance**: Consider disassembly for service

### Common Assembly Pitfalls

```
Problem              | Solution
---------------------|---------------------------
Tolerance stack-up   | Statistical analysis, adjustable features
Access restrictions  | Design for assembly sequence
Part damage          | Guide features, protective surfaces
Alignment issues     | Self-locating features, jigs
Over-constraint      | Kinematic design principles
Thermal expansion    | Sliding joints, expansion gaps
```

## Conclusion

Brunel's assembly methods revolutionized engineering construction through systematic planning, modular design, and careful tolerance management. His principles of prefabrication, standardization, and sequential assembly remain fundamental to modern practice. FreeCAD's assembly workbench allows us to simulate and validate these assembly processes digitally, catching issues before physical construction begins. The key insight remains: successful assembly requires as much engineering as the design itself - it must be planned, analyzed, and optimized with the same rigor applied to structural analysis.
