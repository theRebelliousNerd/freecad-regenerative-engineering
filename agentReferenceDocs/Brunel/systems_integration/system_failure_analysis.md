## System Failure Analysis

### Common System-Level Failures
1. **Interface Failures**: Poor force transfer between subsystems
2. **Cascade Failures**: Single component failure propagating through system
3. **Integration Failures**: Subsystems working individually but failing together
4. **Scaling Failures**: Designs that work at small scale failing when enlarged

### Brunel's Solutions
- **Redundancy**: Multiple load paths (double hull on Great Eastern)
- **Over-engineering**: Safety factors well above minimum requirements
- **Progressive Construction**: Validate as you build (Thames Tunnel shield)
- **Standardization**: Reduce integration complexity through common interfaces
