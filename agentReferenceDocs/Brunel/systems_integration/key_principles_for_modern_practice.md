## Key Principles for Modern Practice

### 1. Never Accept Vague Requirements
- Transform "strong enough" into "withstand 1000N with FOS 2.5"
- Convert "fits together" into "0.1mm tolerance on mating surfaces"
- Change "looks good" into specific geometric constraints

### 2. Think in Load Paths
- Every force must have a complete path to ground
- Stress concentrations occur at geometry changes
- Redundant paths increase reliability

### 3. Design for Assembly
- Consider construction sequence from the start
- Plan for tolerances and adjustments
- Ensure maintenance accessibility
- Document critical assembly operations

### 4. Validate at Every Level
- Test components individually
- Verify subsystem integration
- Validate complete system performance
- Document all test results
