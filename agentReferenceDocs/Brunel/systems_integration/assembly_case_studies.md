## Case Studies

### Case 1: Clifton Suspension Bridge Chain Assembly

```
Challenge: Assemble 1000-ton chains across 214m gorge

Solution:
1. Build temporary bridge at deck level
2. Lay chains on temporary platform
3. Connect links progressively
4. Jack chains to final position
5. Remove temporary structure

Key Innovation:
- Assembly at accessible height
- Gravity assists final positioning
- Links added without stress
```

### Case 2: Crystal Palace Influence on Paddington

```
Crystal Palace (1851):        Paddington Station (1854):
- 3300 iron columns       →    - 200 iron arches
- 300,000 glass panes    →    - Glass roof panels
- 6 months assembly      →    - 4 months assembly
- Modular 24ft bays      →    - Modular arch spacing

Transfer of Knowledge:
- Same contractor (Fox, Henderson)
- Refined connection details
- Improved glass mounting
- Better drainage design
```
