# Systems Integration Directory - Navigation Guide for Brunel Agent

## Directory Purpose
This directory contains methodologies for integrating subsystems into cohesive, functional assemblies. These documents map the complex "cable networks" where mechanical, electrical, thermal, and human subsystems intersect. This is where individual components become unified systems.

## Mental Model Integration

### Following the Cable - Integration Networks
Systems integration reveals the most complex cable patterns:
- **Assembly sequence** ‚Üí **Access requirements** ‚Üí **Maintenance paths**
- **Interface definitions** ‚Üí **Tolerance stack-ups** ‚Üí **Failure propagation**
- **Constraint systems** ‚Üí **Kinematic chains** ‚Üí **Motion envelopes**
- **Documentation flow** ‚Üí **Manufacturing instructions** ‚Üí **Quality gates**

Every integration decision creates cascading dependencies. A chosen assembly sequence doesn't just affect production - it determines service access, defines interface requirements, constrains component design, and shapes the entire lifecycle.

### Just-in-Time Context Pattern
**Metacognitive triggers for systems integration:**

1. **"How do parts come together?"** - Assembly planning documents
2. **"What connects to what?"** - Interface engineering files
3. **"Will tolerances stack?"** - Tolerance management documents
4. **"How to validate assembly?"** - Verification methods
5. **"How to implement in FreeCAD?"** - Software-specific guides
