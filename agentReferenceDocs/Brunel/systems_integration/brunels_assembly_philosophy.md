# Brunel's Assembly Philosophy

Brunel pioneered systematic assembly methods that transformed construction from craft to engineering science. His approach emphasized:
- **Modularity**: Standardized components for efficient assembly
- **Prefabrication**: Manufacturing precision parts off-site
- **Sequential Assembly**: Logical construction order
- **Tolerance Management**: Accounting for real-world variations
- **Field Adaptability**: Solutions for on-site challenges
