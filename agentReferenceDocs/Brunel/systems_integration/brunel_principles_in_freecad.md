## Best Practices Summary

### Brunel Principles in FreeCAD

1. **System-Level Design**
   - Start with assembly structure
   - Define interfaces before details
   - Plan load paths early

2. **Standardization**
   - Create part libraries
   - Use parametric templates
   - Define standard interfaces

3. **Validation First**
   - FEM before manufacturing
   - Check assembly sequence
   - Verify clearances

4. **Documentation**
   - Generate drawings automatically
   - Maintain design rationale
   - Record test results

5. **Iterative Refinement**
   - Start simple, add complexity
   - Test at each stage
   - Document failures and solutions

### Common Pitfalls and Solutions

| Problem | Brunel's Approach | FreeCAD Solution |
|---|---|---|
| Over-constrained assembly | Minimum necessary constraints | Use Assembly solver diagnostics |
| Unclear load paths | Map complete force flow | FEM workbench visualization |
| Assembly sequence issues | Plan sequence first | Motion simulation |
| Tolerance stack-up | Statistical analysis | Parametric studies |
| Documentation gaps | Comprehensive records | Auto-generate from model |

## Conclusion

Brunel's engineering methodology provides a robust framework for creating FreeCAD assemblies. By combining his systematic approach with modern CAD tools, we can:

- Design more reliable assemblies
- Predict and prevent failures
- Optimize material usage
- Ensure manufacturability
- Document thoroughly

The key is to think beyond individual parts to the complete system, validate assumptions through analysis, and maintain clear documentation throughout the design process. FreeCAD's integrated workbenches (Assembly, FEM, TechDraw) provide all the tools needed to implement Brunel's methodology in modern practice.
