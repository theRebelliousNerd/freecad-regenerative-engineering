## Assembly Sequencing

### Critical Path Method (Brunel's Approach)

```
Thames Tunnel Assembly Sequence:
1. Sink access shaft
2. Install tunneling shield
3. Excavate 1ft sections
4. Install brick lining immediately
5. Advance shield
6. Repeat steps 3-5

Parallel Operations:
- Brick manufacturing
- Pump operation
- Material transport
- Survey verification
```

### Box Tunnel Construction

Six simultaneous work faces via vertical shafts:

```
    Shaft1  Shaft2  Shaft3  Shaft4  Shaft5  Shaft6
      ↓       ↓       ↓       ↓       ↓       ↓
West→[ ]←→[ ]←→[ ]←→[ ]←→[ ]←→[ ]←→[ ]→East
    Face1  Face2  Face3  Face4  Face5  Face6

Assembly Rate:
- 14 active faces
- 6 yards/week per face
- Total: 84 yards/week
- Completion: 30 months
```
