## Assembly Tools and Equipment

### Historical Methods

```
Brunel's Lifting Equipment:

Shear Legs:
    /\     Capacity: 20 tons
   /  \    Height: 30ft
  /    \   Material: Timber
 /      \
/________\

Compound Pulley System:
Mechanical Advantage = 8:1
1 ton pull → 8 ton lift
Speed Ratio = 1:8
```

### Great Eastern Launch System

Complex assembly for sideways launch:
```
Components:
- 2 × 80-ton hydraulic rams
- 2 × 200-ton screw jacks
- Cradles on greased ways
- Chain cables for control
- Steam winches for recovery

Launch Sequence:
1. Remove shores progressively
2. Engage hydraulic rams
3. Controlled slide on ways
4. Float on high tide
```
