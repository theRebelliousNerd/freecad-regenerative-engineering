## Case Study: Great Western Railway System

Brunel's GWR demonstrates systems thinking at scale:

### System Requirements
- Connect London to Bristol (118 miles)
- Maximum gradient 1 in 1000 (except Box Tunnel at 1 in 100)
- Support future expansion and increased speeds
- Integrate stations, bridges, tunnels, and track

### Subsystem Integration
1. **Track System**: 7ft broad gauge for stability and speed
2. **Bridge System**: Standardized designs adapted to local conditions
3. **Tunnel System**: Box Tunnel with precision surveying (2-inch alignment error over 1.83 miles)
4. **Station System**: Paddington's modular iron and glass construction

### System-Level Optimization
- Flat route through Reading and Swindon despite longer distance
- Integrated drainage systems throughout
- Coordinated construction allowing simultaneous progress on multiple sections
