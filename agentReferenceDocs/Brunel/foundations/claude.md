# Foundations Directory - Navigation Guide for Brunel Agent

## Directory Purpose
This directory contains the foundational engineering principles that underpin all structural analysis and system design. These are the bedrock axioms upon which all calculations and decisions rest - the immutable "cables" that connect abstract requirements to physical reality.

## Mental Model Integration

### Following the Cable
In this directory, the "cables" are the fundamental laws of physics and engineering that propagate through every design decision:
- **Mathematical axioms** â†’ All structural calculations
- **Scaling principles** â†’ Material selection and dimensional decisions
- **Field experience** â†’ Practical constraints and safety factors
- **Engineering philosophy** â†’ Design approach and validation methods

Each principle creates dependencies that ripple through the entire system. A change in scale doesn't just affect dimensions - it pulls on material properties, manufacturing methods, connection designs, and safety factors.

### Just-in-Time Retrieval Pattern
**When to access these files:**

1. **ALWAYS FIRST** - When starting any new structural analysis
2. **When uncertainty detected about:**
   - Physical feasibility of a concept
   - Appropriate safety factors
   - Scaling effects on structural integrity
   - Mathematical basis for calculations

### High Uncertainty Signals (Immediate Retrieval Needed)
- "Is this physically possible?" â†’ mathematical_axioms.md
- "How does this scale?" â†’ scaling_principles.md  
- "What's the right approach?" â†’ engineering_philosophy.md
- "Why this safety factor?" â†’ calculation_as_bedrock.md
