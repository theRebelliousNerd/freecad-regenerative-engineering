# Field Implementation Directory - Navigation Guide for Brunel Agent

## Directory Purpose
This directory contains methodologies for translating engineering designs from theoretical perfection to practical reality. It addresses the "cable" between conception and construction, where theoretical calculations meet physical constraints, human limitations, and environmental variables.

## Mental Model Integration

### Following the Cable - Theory to Reality Connections
The most critical "cable" in engineering connects:
- **Design intent** â†’ **Construction methods** â†’ **Actual performance**
- **Theoretical calculations** â†’ **Field conditions** â†’ **Safety margins**
- **Assembly drawings** â†’ **Real materials** â†’ **Human operators**
- **Perfect geometry** â†’ **Practical tolerances** â†’ **Functional systems**

This cable often carries the highest stress in any project. Field implementation is where design assumptions are tested against physics, economics, and human capabilities.

### Just-in-Time Context Pattern
**Metacognitive triggers for field implementation:**

1. **"Will this actually build?"** - Constructability analysis
2. **"What if conditions differ?"** - Adaptation strategies
3. **"How to troubleshoot?"** - Problem-solving methods
4. **"What are real constraints?"** - Practical limitations
5. **"How to ensure quality?"** - Field validation methods

### High Uncertainty Scenarios (Immediate Retrieval)
```
"Will this work in the field?" â†’ construction_problem_solving.md
"Conditions differ from design?" â†’ construction_problem_solving.md  
"Unexpected problems arise?" â†’ construction_problem_solving.md
"Need to adapt on-site?" â†’ construction_problem_solving.md
```

### Problem Categories & Solutions
1. **Site Condition Variations**
   - Foundation conditions differ from geotechnical report
   - Environmental conditions exceed design parameters
   - Access limitations not considered in design

2. **Material Performance Deviations**
   - Actual properties differ from specifications
   - Supply chain substitutions required
   - Quality variations in delivered materials

3. **Construction Method Limitations**
   - Equipment not available as planned
   - Skill level insufficient for design complexity
   - Assembly sequence impractical in field

4. **Economic & Schedule Pressures**
   - Cost overruns require design changes
   - Schedule compression affects quality
   - Resource allocation conflicts

2. IDENTIFY root causes vs. symptoms  
3. GENERATE alternatives maintaining critical performance
4. EVALUATE options against constraints (cost, time, safety)
5. IMPLEMENT chosen solution with monitoring
6. DOCUMENT changes for future reference

### Follow the Cable Application
Every field problem reveals previously invisible cables:
- Material substitution affects thermal expansion
- Construction sequence change impacts tolerance stack-up
- Equipment limitation requires structural modification
- Weather delay creates quality control challenges

### Just-in-Time Context Application
Field implementation IS the ultimate JIT scenario:
- Problems emerge unpredictably
- Solutions must be rapid and accurate
- Context window is limited by crisis timeline
- Retrieval must be precise and actionable
