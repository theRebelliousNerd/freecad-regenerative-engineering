## Connection Design for Load Transfer

### Principles
1. **Capacity**: Connection stronger than members
2. **Stiffness**: Compatible with member stiffness
3. **Ductility**: Ability to redistribute loads
4. **Redundancy**: Multiple fasteners/welds

### Load Transfer Mechanisms

#### Bearing
```
   Bolt
    │
 ┌──▼──┐
 │plate│  Force transferred through contact
 └─────┘
```

#### Shear
```
 ───┬───
    │    Bolt in double shear
 ───┼───
    │
 ───┴───
```

#### Friction
```
 ═══╪═══  Pretensioned connection
    ║     Force transferred by friction
 ═══╪═══
```
