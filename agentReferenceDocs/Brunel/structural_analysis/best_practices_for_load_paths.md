## Best Practices

1. **Always trace complete load paths** - from application to ground
2. **Identify critical paths** - those carrying maximum load
3. **Check stress concentrations** - at every geometry change
4. **Verify load sharing** - in redundant systems
5. **Consider all load cases** - dead, live, environmental
6. **Document assumptions** - for future verification
7. **Validate with testing/FEM** - trust but verify
