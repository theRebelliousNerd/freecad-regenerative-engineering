## Connection Analysis

### Riveted Connections (Historical)
```
Shear Strength (single rivet):
P_s = π/4 × d² × τ_allowable

Bearing Strength:
P_b = d × t × σ_bearing

Tensile Strength (plate):
P_t = (p - d) × t × σ_tensile

Connection Capacity:
P_allowable = min(P_s, P_b, P_t) × n_rivets
```

### Modern Bolted Connections
```
Bolt Tension:
T = F × e / (n × r)

Combined Stress:
(σ_tensile/σ_t_allow)² + (τ_shear/τ_allow)² ≤ 1
```
