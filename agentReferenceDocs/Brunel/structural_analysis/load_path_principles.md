# Load Paths and Stress Distribution

## Fundamental Concept

A load path is the route that forces take through a structure from the point of application to the ground or reaction points. Understanding and optimizing load paths is critical for structural integrity and efficiency.

## Load Path Principles

### Primary Rule
**Every force must have a complete, continuous path to ground**

Forces cannot simply disappear - they must be transferred through structural members until they reach a reaction point (ground, foundation, or support).

### Load Path Components

4. Secondary Members

5. Support Reactions

7. Ground
