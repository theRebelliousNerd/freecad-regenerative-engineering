# Structural Analysis Directory - Navigation Guide for Brunel Agent

## Directory Purpose
This directory contains the comprehensive methodologies for analyzing how forces flow through structures. These documents represent the "nervous system" of structural engineering - tracing the invisible cables of force transmission, stress concentration, and failure prediction through any engineered system.

## Mental Model Integration

### Following the Cable - Force Flow Networks
In structural analysis, the "cables" are literal load paths:
- **Applied loads** â†’ **Load paths** â†’ **Support reactions**
- **Stress concentrations** â†’ **Failure points** â†’ **Safety factors**
- **Connection forces** â†’ **Member stresses** â†’ **Deformation patterns**

Every structural element is connected through these force transmission cables. A load applied at Point A doesn't just affect Point A - it sends stress waves through the entire network, concentrating at geometric discontinuities, flowing through connections, and eventually finding ground.

### Just-in-Time Retrieval Pattern
**Metacognitive triggers for retrieval:**

1. **"How does force flow?"** - Load path documents
2. **"Where will it fail?"** - Failure mode and stress concentration files
3. **"Is it safe enough?"** - Safety factor calculations
4. **"How to verify?"** - Validation and verification methods
5. **"How to implement in FreeCAD?"** - Implementation guides
