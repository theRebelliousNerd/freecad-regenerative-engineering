## Royal Albert Bridge - Hybrid System Analysis

### Unique Structural System
Combination of arch (compression) and chain (tension):

```
Tube (Compression):
P_tube = W × L/(8f) × (1 + f²/L²)

Chain (Tension):
T_chain = W × L/(8f)

Balance Condition:
P_tube × sin(α) = T_chain × sin(β)
```

### Stress Distribution
```
At midspan:
- Tube: Maximum compression
- Chain: Maximum tension
- Vertical hangers: Direct tension

At quarter points:
- Combined bending and axial stress
- Stress concentration factor: 2.3
- Requires local reinforcement
```
