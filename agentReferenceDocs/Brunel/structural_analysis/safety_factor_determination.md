## Safety Factor Determination

### Brunel's Approach
```
FOS = Ultimate Strength / Working Stress

Typical Values:
- Steady loads, known material: 2.0-3.0
- Variable loads: 3.0-4.0
- Impact loads: 4.0-6.0
- Cast iron (brittle): 4.0-5.0
- Wrought iron (ductile): 3.0-4.0
```

### Modern Standards
```
Load Factors (LRFD):
1.4D + 1.6L  (strength)
1.0D + 1.0L  (serviceability)

where D = dead load, L = live load
```
