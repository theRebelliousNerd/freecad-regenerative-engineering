## FreeCAD Implementation

### Load Path Visualization
```python
# In FreeCAD FEM workbench
def visualize_load_path(fem_results):
    """
    Create vector plot showing force flow
    """
    # Extract principal stress directions
    principal_stresses = fem_results.PrincipalMax
    
    # Create vector field
    vectors = []
    for node in fem_results.Nodes:
        stress_vector = principal_stresses[node]
        vectors.append(stress_vector)
    
    # Display as arrows
    Part.show(vectors, "LoadPath")
```

### Assembly Load Transfer
```python
# Define assembly constraints that transfer loads
assembly = App.ActiveDocument.Assembly

# Coincident constraint - transfers all forces
constraint1 = assembly.add_constraint(
    type="Coincident",
    transfers=["Fx", "Fy", "Fz"]
)

# Parallel constraint - transfers normal force only
constraint2 = assembly.add_constraint(
    type="Parallel", 
    transfers=["Fn"]
)
```
