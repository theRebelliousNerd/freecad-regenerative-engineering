## Great Eastern - Hull Stress Analysis

### Double Hull Benefits
```
Moment of Inertia (double hull):
I_double = I_outer + I_inner + A × d²

where d = separation between hulls

Increase in strength: ~300% for 15% weight increase
```

### Longitudinal Bending
```
Hogging Moment (wave crest amidships):
M_hog = W × L² / 24

Sagging Moment (wave trough amidships):
M_sag = W × L² / 12

Maximum Stress:
σ = M × y / I_total
```

### Plate Buckling
```
Critical Buckling Stress:
σ_cr = k × π² × E / (12(1-ν²)) × (t/b)²

where:
  k = buckling coefficient (depends on edge conditions)
  t = plate thickness
  b = plate width
  ν = Poisson's ratio
```
