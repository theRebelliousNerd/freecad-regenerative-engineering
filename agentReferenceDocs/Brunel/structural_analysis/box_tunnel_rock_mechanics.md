## Box Tunnel - Rock Mechanics

### Stress Around Circular Opening
```
Radial Stress: σ_r = σ_0(1 - a²/r²)
Tangential Stress: σ_θ = σ_0(1 + a²/r²)

where:
  σ_0 = in-situ stress
  a = tunnel radius
  r = distance from center

Maximum stress concentration: 2σ_0 at tunnel wall
```

### Support Requirements
```
Rock Load (Terzaghi):
P = γ × B × (1 - 2c/(γB))

where:
  γ = unit weight of rock
  B = tunnel width
  c = cohesion

Arch thickness required:
t = P × R / σ_allowable
```
