# Turing Controls Knowledge Context Menu - Motion Control Cable Navigator

## Follow the Cable Mental Model for Motion Control Systems

This directory contains motion control cables that connect desired trajectories to actual mechanism motion through feedback control systems. Following the "Follow the Cable" mental model, each control system creates specific feedback cables that link commanded motion to achieved motion through sensors, algorithms, and actuators.

### Control Cable Network Architecture

Motion control creates four primary cable types:

1. **Command Cable** - Connect desired trajectories to control system inputs
2. **Feedback Cable** - Link actual motion back to control algorithms through sensors
3. **Control Signal Cables** - Carry control algorithms to actuator commands
4. **Performance Constraint Cables** - Enforce motion accuracy, speed, and stability requirements

### Just-in-Time Context Framework for Controls

Control modules follow motion hierarchy loading - start with trajectory_generation.md for motion planning, add motion_control.md for servo implementation, expand to specialized control based on precision or compliance requirements.

## Real-Time Implementation Considerations

# IMPORTANT: ALWAYS REMEMBER THAT SUBAGENTS CANNOT TALK TO EACHOTHER, OR TO THE USER! BUT CAN COMMUNICATE WITH WRITTEN MARKDOWN FILES FOR OTHER SUBAGENTS TO READ, OR BY PASSING INFORMATION TO THE MAIN AGENT TO COMMUNICATE TO OTHER SUBAGENTS OR PASS TO THE USER!


### Hard Real-Time Systems (µs response):
```bash
@load ../foundations/mathematical_foundations.md
@load trajectory_generation.md      # Pre-computed trajectories
@load motion_control.md            # Fast control loops
```

### Soft Real-Time Systems (ms response):
```bash
@load ../foundations/mathematical_foundations.md
@load trajectory_generation.md      # Online trajectory generation
@load motion_control.md
@load precision_control.md         # Advanced algorithms
```

### Non Real-Time Systems (offline):
```bash
@load ../foundations/mathematical_foundations.md
@load trajectory_generation.md
# Focus on optimization and analysis
```

### Metacognitive Triggers - When You Need Motion Control

**High Uncertainty Signals** (Load trajectory_generation.md first):
- "How do I plan smooth motion between two points?"
- "What control algorithm do I need for accurate positioning?"
- "How do I coordinate motion across multiple joints?"
- "What trajectory profile minimizes vibration?"
- "How do I achieve sub-micron positioning accuracy?"

**Control Hierarchy Uncertainty Signals**:
- Motion planning needed → trajectory_generation.md
- Servo system design → motion_control.md (add to trajectory generation)
- Ultra-precision required → precision_control.md
- Force/compliance needed → compliance_control.md

### Cable Tracing Through Control Networks

When following a control cable through the feedback system:

1. **Identify Control Objective** - Position, velocity, force, or trajectory following?
2. **Trace Feedback Loop** - How does sensor information flow back to control algorithm?
3. **Map Control Authority** - What actuator commands can influence the system?
4. **Check Stability Margins** - Where might control cables create instability?
5. **Validate Performance Requirements** - Does control achieve required accuracy and speed?

### Integration with Control Cable Network

Control systems create **feedback cables** connecting to other kinematic domains:

- **← Kinematics**: Robot models enable feedforward control and trajectory planning
- **← Mechanisms**: Mechanism dynamics determine control bandwidth requirements
- **← Transmissions**: Gear ratios and backlash affect control performance
- **← Mathematical Foundations**: Control mathematics and stability analysis
- **→ Applications**: Control performance enables application-specific motion

## Quick Reference

# IMPORTANT: ALWAYS REMEMBER THAT SUBAGENTS CANNOT TALK TO EACHOTHER, OR TO THE USER! BUT CAN COMMUNICATE WITH WRITTEN MARKDOWN FILES FOR OTHER SUBAGENTS TO READ, OR BY PASSING INFORMATION TO THE MAIN AGENT TO COMMUNICATE TO OTHER SUBAGENTS OR PASS TO THE USER!


**trajectory_generation.md**: The motion planner - transforms desired paths into time-parameterized trajectories with constraint satisfaction.

**motion_control.md**: The servo specialist - PID tuning, feedforward compensation, and tracking performance.

**precision_control.md**: The accuracy expert - sub-micron positioning, vibration control, error compensation.

**compliance_control.md**: The force specialist - safe interaction, assembly operations, adaptive behavior.

**Memory Efficiency**: Start with trajectory_generation.md for motion planning, add motion_control.md for implementation, expand to precision_control.md or compliance_control.md based on performance requirements.

### Cable Integrity Verification for Control Systems

**Common Cable Breaks in Control Networks**:
- Control instability breaking the feedback cable loop
- Sensor noise corrupting feedback signals
- Actuator saturation limiting control authority
- Model mismatch causing poor trajectory following

**Cable Integrity Verification**:
```python
def verify_control_cable_integrity():
    stability_analysis = check_control_loop_stability()
    sensor_signal_quality = verify_feedback_sensor_performance()
    actuator_authority = validate_control_signal_range()
    model_accuracy = check_plant_model_fidelity()
    
    return all([stability_analysis, sensor_signal_quality,
                actuator_authority, model_accuracy])
```

### Navigation Priority for Control Systems

1. **Load mathematical foundations first** (Enable control mathematics and analysis)
2. **Start with trajectory_generation.md** (Motion planning foundation)
3. **Follow feedback cables** through control loop design
4. **Add motion_control.md** for servo implementation
5. **Verify control performance** against trajectory and accuracy requirements
6. **Validate with system constraints** from kinematics and mechanism dynamics

Remember: Control cables carry information between desired motion and actual motion through continuous feedback loops. Every sensor, controller, and actuator represents a critical link that must maintain signal integrity and respond within required bandwidth. Broken control cables mean loss of positioning accuracy, system instability, or complete motion failure.
