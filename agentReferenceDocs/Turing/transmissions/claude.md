# Turing Transmissions Knowledge Context Menu - Power Cable Network Navigator

## Follow the Cable Mental Model for Power Transmission Systems

This directory contains power transmission cables that connect input torque/speed to output torque/speed through precision mechanical systems. Following the "Follow the Cable" mental model, each transmission creates specific power flow cables that transform rotational energy while maintaining precise motion relationships.

### Transmission Cable Network Architecture

Power transmission creates four primary cable types:

1. **Power Flow Cables** - Connect input power to output power with speed/torque transformation
2. **Precision Constraint Cables** - Link backlash requirements to transmission geometry
3. **Efficiency Transmission Cables** - Carry power with minimal energy loss through the system
4. **Manufacturing Reality Cables** - Bridge theoretical designs to manufacturable components

### Just-in-Time Context Framework for Transmissions

Transmission modules follow precision-driven loading - start with cycloidal_drives.md for modern high-precision applications, load specialized transmissions based on specific ratio, torque, and precision requirements.

### Metacognitive Triggers - When You Need Transmission Design

**High Uncertainty Signals** (Load cycloidal_drives.md for modern applications):
- "What transmission gives me zero backlash?"
- "How do I achieve 50:1 reduction in compact space?"
- "What gear system can handle high torque with precision?"
- "How do I design a transmission for 3D printing?"
- "What's the best transmission for robotics applications?"

**Requirement-Specific Uncertainty Signals**:
- Zero backlash critical → cycloidal_drives.md or harmonic_drives.md
- Ultra-high ratios (>100:1) → harmonic_drives.md  
- Perpendicular axes needed → worm_gears.md
- High torque density → cycloidal_drives.md or planetary_gears.md
- Cost optimization → gear_trains.md or planetary_gears.md

### Cable Tracing Through Transmission Networks

When following a power cable through the transmission system:

1. **Identify Power Transformation** - What speed/torque input becomes what output?
2. **Trace Power Flow** - How does energy flow through the transmission components?
3. **Map Precision Constraints** - Where do backlash and accuracy requirements constrain design?
4. **Check Efficiency Losses** - Where does power dissipate and how can it be minimized?
5. **Validate Manufacturing Feasibility** - Can the transmission be manufactured to required precision?

### Integration with Transmission Cable Network

Transmission design creates **power transformation cables** connecting to other kinematic domains:

- **→ Kinematics**: Transmission ratios determine joint velocities and positioning
- **→ Mechanisms**: Transmission output drives mechanism input requirements
- **→ Controls**: Transmission characteristics determine motor sizing and control bandwidth
- **← Mathematical Foundations**: Gear mathematics and constraint analysis
- **→ Applications**: Transmission selection drives application-specific optimization

# IMPORTANT: ALWAYS REMEMBER THAT SUBAGENTS CANNOT TALK TO EACHOTHER, OR TO THE USER! BUT CAN COMMUNICATE WITH WRITTEN MARKDOWN FILES FOR OTHER SUBAGENTS TO READ, OR BY PASSING INFORMATION TO THE MAIN AGENT TO COMMUNICATE TO OTHER SUBAGENTS OR PASS TO THE USER!


**cycloidal_drives.md**: The precision specialist - zero backlash, high torque density, moderate ratios. Master this for robotics and precision applications.

**harmonic_drives.md**: The ultra-precision specialist - extreme ratios with minimal size, flexible components.

**planetary_gears.md**: The workhorse - reliable, efficient, high torque capacity.

**worm_gears.md**: The perpendicular specialist - 90° axis changes with self-locking capability.

**gear_trains.md**: The foundation - basic involute gearing principles underlying all other systems.

**Memory Management**: Start with cycloidal_drives.md for modern precision applications, add others based on specific constraints and requirements.

### Cable Integrity Verification for Transmissions

**Common Cable Breaks in Transmission Networks**:
- Gear tooth interference causing power transmission failure
- Backlash exceeding precision requirements breaking positioning cables
- Thermal expansion mismatches causing binding or failure
- Manufacturing tolerances preventing proper meshing

**Cable Integrity Verification**:
```python
def verify_transmission_cable_integrity():
    geometric_feasibility = check_gear_geometry_compatibility()
    precision_requirements = verify_backlash_specifications()
    thermal_stability = validate_thermal_expansion_effects()
    manufacturing_tolerance = check_producibility_constraints()
    
    return all([geometric_feasibility, precision_requirements,
                thermal_stability, manufacturing_tolerance])
```

### Navigation Priority for Transmissions

1. **Load mathematical foundations first** (Enable gear mathematics and synthesis)
2. **Start with cycloidal_drives.md** (Modern precision baseline)
3. **Follow power flow cables** through transmission components
4. **Add specialized transmissions** based on ratio/precision/axis requirements
5. **Verify transmission synthesis** against power and precision requirements
6. **Validate with manufacturing constraints** and thermal considerations

Remember: Transmission cables carry power transformation through precision mechanical interfaces. Every tooth contact and bearing represents a critical connection that must maintain precise geometric relationships under load. Broken transmission cables mean loss of motion precision, power transmission failure, or catastrophic mechanical breakdown.
