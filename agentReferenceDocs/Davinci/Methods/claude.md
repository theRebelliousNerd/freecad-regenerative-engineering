# Methods Domain - Practical Implementation Guide & Cable Network Construction

## Systematic Application of Da Vincian Principles

This domain transforms Leonardo's philosophical insights into practical FreeCAD methodologies, providing concrete approaches for implementing predetermined perfection in digital design.

### **The Cable Network Construction Philosophy**
Each method serves as a **cable-laying methodology** - systematic approaches for establishing dependency relationships between design intent and geometric reality. Drawing-as-thinking creates **visualization cables** connecting abstract concepts to spatial relationships. Mathematical foundations establish **parametric cables** connecting functional requirements to dimensional specifications. These methods don't just solve problems; they architect the dependency networks that make solutions inevitable.

### **Just-in-Time Method Retrieval**
The JITC framework enables **contextual method loading**: when facing kinematic uncertainty, only the relevant sections of drawing_as_thinking.md are retrieved - specifically the multi-view analysis and constraint dialogue protocols. When dimensional relationships lack mathematical foundation, only the proportional systems and measurement hierarchy from mathematical_foundations.md are activated. This prevents cognitive overload while ensuring precise tool availability.

### **Drawing as Thinking - Essential Techniques**

**The Three-Sketch Rule**:
1. **Concept sketch**: Raw idea capture with basic proportions
2. **Engineering sketch**: Mechanism detail with mathematical relationships
3. **Production sketch**: Manufacturing and assembly considerations

**Constraint Dialogue Process**:
- Failure ‚Üí Analysis ‚Üí Understanding ‚Üí Alternative ‚Üí Integration
- Never force constraints; always understand what they're teaching

**Multi-View Requirements**:
- Kinematic: How does it move?
- Structural: Where do forces flow?  
- Assembly: How do parts connect?
- Service: How is it maintained?

### **Mathematical Foundations - Core Calculations**

**Proportional Relationships**:
```
œÜ = 1.618 (golden ratio)
‚àö2 = 1.414 (harmonic proportion)  
Base_Module √ó œÜ^n = hierarchical scaling
```

**Human-Scale Integration**:
```
Hand_Width = 75-100mm (control sizing)

```

**Mathematical Validation Checklist**:
- [ ] Every dimension has mathematical justification
- [ ] Proportional relationships maintain harmony
