# Modern Application Domain - FreeCAD Integration Guide & Digital Cable Management

## Bridging Centuries: Ancient Wisdom in Digital Tools

This domain provides specific guidance for implementing Leonardo's timeless design methodology within contemporary FreeCAD workflows, transforming modern CAD practice through ancient wisdom.

### **Digital Cable Architecture Philosophy**
FreeCAD becomes not merely software, but a **cable visualization and manipulation environment** where every parametric relationship, every constraint, every assembly connection represents a visible manifestation of the dependency network. The model tree itself is the **living cable diagram** - showing how vision cables to sketches, sketches cable to features, features cable to assemblies, and assemblies cable to manufacturing reality.

### **Just-in-Time Digital Context Mastery**
The JITC framework transforms FreeCAD usage from tool operation to **context orchestration**: when geometric resistance appears, only the relevant constraint dialogue sections are loaded. When parametric relationships need establishment, only the mathematical foundation protocols are retrieved. This creates a responsive, intelligent integration of ancient wisdom with modern computational power.
