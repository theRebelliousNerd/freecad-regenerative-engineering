# Foundational Principles - Manufacturing Physics as Natural Law

## Overview
This directory contains the core manufacturing physics that govern 3D printing. These are not guidelines but natural laws - as immutable as gravity. Every "cable" in the Follow the Cable model traces back to these fundamental constraints.

## Follow the Cable Mental Model Integration

### Manufacturing Constraints as Cables
In the Follow the Cable framework, manufacturing constraints are not limitations but **dependency cables** that connect design decisions to physical reality. Each manufacturing principle creates cables that propagate throughout the entire design network:

- **Wall thickness constraints** ‚Üí cables to nozzle diameter ‚Üí cables to material flow ‚Üí cables to structural integrity
- **Layer adhesion properties** ‚Üí cables to print orientation ‚Üí cables to stress paths ‚Üí cables to failure modes  
- **Thermal behavior** ‚Üí cables to material selection ‚Üí cables to part geometry ‚Üí cables to cooling requirements
- **Support requirements** ‚Üí cables to overhang angles ‚Üí cables to surface finish ‚Üí cables to post-processing time

### The Manufacturing Cable Network
Manufacturing is the **prime mover** in the cable network - it reaches backward to constrain all upstream design decisions. A 0.4mm nozzle diameter isn't a preference; it's a physical quantum that cables backward through:
- Minimum wall thickness (1.2mm = 3 perimeters)
- Feature resolution limits
- Internal channel dimensions
- Assembly clearances
- Overall part proportions

## Just-in-Time Context (JITC) Application

# IMPORTANT: ALWAYS REMEMBER THAT SUBAGENTS CANNOT TALK TO EACHOTHER, OR TO THE USER! BUT CAN COMMUNICATE WITH WRITTEN MARKDOWN FILES FOR OTHER SUBAGENTS TO READ, OR BY PASSING INFORMATION TO THE MAIN AGENT TO COMMUNICATE TO OTHER SUBAGENTS OR PASS TO THE USER!


### Metacognitive Triggers for Manufacturing Uncertainty
The JITC framework helps recognize when manufacturing knowledge gaps emerge:

**High-Certainty Scenarios** (low retrieval threshold):
- Standard wall thicknesses with proven materials
- Simple geometries within established design rules
- Well-characterized print orientations

**High-Uncertainty Scenarios** (immediate knowledge retrieval):
- Novel material combinations
- Complex multi-physics interactions (thermal + structural)
- Untested geometric features
- Production scaling challenges

### Context Retrieval Priorities
When manufacturing uncertainty is detected, prioritize loading:
1. **Core principles** (this directory) - always loaded first
2. **Material-specific constraints** - based on material selection
3. **Geometry-specific rules** - based on feature complexity
4. **Latest research** - for novel applications or failure modes

### Cable Trace: Wall Thickness Decision
```
Design Decision: "Make enclosure wall 0.6mm thick"
‚Üì
Manufacturing Cable Analysis:
- 0.6mm < 1.2mm minimum ‚Üí VIOLATION
- 0.4mm nozzle √ó 3 perimeters = 1.2mm minimum
- 0.6mm = 1.5 perimeters ‚Üí impossible to print reliably
‚Üì
Cable Propagation:
- Structural integrity compromised ‚Üí increased failure risk
- Print quality degraded ‚Üí higher defect rate  
- Production yield reduced ‚Üí increased cost
- Customer satisfaction impacted ‚Üí market risk
‚Üì
Resolution: Increase wall thickness to 1.2mm minimum
```

### Cable Trace: Print Orientation Selection
```
Design Decision: "Print part flat on build plate"
‚Üì
Manufacturing Cable Analysis:
- Flat orientation ‚Üí large bed contact area
- Large contact area ‚Üí difficult automated ejection
- Difficult ejection ‚Üí manual intervention required
- Manual intervention ‚Üí breaks automation cable
‚Üì
Alternative Orientation Analysis:
- 45¬∞ angle ‚Üí minimal bed contact
- Minimal contact ‚Üí easy ejection
- Easy ejection ‚Üí maintains automation
- BUT: may introduce overhangs requiring supports
‚Üì
Resolution: Redesign geometry to eliminate overhangs at 45¬∞ orientation

As Gabe, you are the guardian of manufacturing reality. When you detect violations of these foundational principles:

1. **STOP** - Do not proceed with violated design
2. **TRACE** - Follow the cable back to the root decision
3. **EDUCATE** - Explain the physical reality behind the constraint
4. **REDESIGN** - Propose manufacturing-compatible alternatives
5. **VALIDATE** - Confirm the solution satisfies all manufacturing cables

Remember: Every manufacturing constraint is a **cable** in the system's nervous system. Cutting a cable breaks the entire network. Your role is to ensure the integrity of the manufacturing cable network while enabling maximum design creativity within physical reality.
