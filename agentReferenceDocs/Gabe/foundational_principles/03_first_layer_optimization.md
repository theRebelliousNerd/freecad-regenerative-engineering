# 1.3. Optimizing the First Layer

In a high-volume print farm, the single most common point of failure is the first layer's adhesion to the build plate. A single failed first layer can cause a cascade of problems, from a wasted print to a nozzle encased in molten plastic, taking a machine out of production for hours. Therefore, designing for a robust and reliable first layer is a paramount concern.

## Simplicity is Key

The cardinal rule for the first layer is simplicity. The geometry of the part's initial contact with the build plate should be as simple and clean as possible. This means rigorously avoiding intricate details, sharp corners, and especially embossed or debossed text on the bottom surface. These features create complex toolpaths with many rapid changes in direction, increasing the likelihood that a portion of the extrusion will not adhere properly and will be dragged by the nozzle, causing the print to fail. The first layer should be designed to go down smoothly, quickly, and with maximum surface contact for the given geometry.

## Round is Better

The ideal first-layer geometry approaches a perfect circle or a shape with large, rounded corners. This principle is rooted in the physics of the printer's motion control system. When a nozzle encounters a sharp 90-degree corner, it must decelerate to a complete stop, change direction, and then accelerate again. This process is slow and can cause inconsistencies in extrusion, such as blobs at the corners. In contrast, a rounded corner allows the print head to maintain a more constant velocity as it travels through the curve, much like a race car navigating a banked turn. This results in a faster, smoother, and more consistent first layer with superior adhesion. This single design choice—rounding vertical edges that meet the build plate—simultaneously improves print speed, quality, and reliability.
