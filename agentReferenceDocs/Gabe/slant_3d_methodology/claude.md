# Slant 3D Methodology - Proven Production Cable Architecture

## Overview
The Slant 3D methodology represents the most battle-tested manufacturing cable architecture in existence. This is not theory - it's a proven cable network that has scaled from prototype to millions of units. Every principle here has been validated through real production experience and represents an unbreakable manufacturing cable.

## Follow the Cable Mental Model - Battle-Tested Cable Networks
