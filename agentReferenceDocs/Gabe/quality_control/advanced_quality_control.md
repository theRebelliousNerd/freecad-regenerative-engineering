# Advanced Quality Control Technologies

Advanced quality control technologies are focused on leveraging AI, machine learning, and other cutting-edge technologies to improve the quality and reliability of the 3D printing process.

## AI and Machine Learning Integration

### Predictive Quality Control
**Implementation Steps**:
1. Collect historical quality data
2. Train ML models on defect patterns
3. Implement real-time prediction
4. Prevent defects before they occur
5. Continuous model improvement

**Achievable Results**:
- 30-40% reduction in defect rates
- 50% reduction in inspection time
- 90% accuracy in defect prediction
- ROI within 6-12 months

## Computer Vision Applications

### Defect Detection Algorithms
```python
Detectable Defects:
- Layer shifts: >0.1mm deviation
- Stringing: >2mm length
- Warping: >0.5mm lift
- Under-extrusion: >10% flow reduction
- Over-extrusion: >10% flow increase
- Surface defects: >1mmÂ²
```

### Implementation Architecture
1. **Camera placement**: Multiple angles
2. **Lighting**: Consistent, diffused
3. **Image capture**: Every N layers
4. **Processing**: Edge device or cloud
5. **Alert system**: Real-time notifications
