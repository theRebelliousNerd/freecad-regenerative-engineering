# Automated Inspection for Quality Control (2024-2025)

In a lights-out manufacturing environment, automated inspection is essential for ensuring that only high-quality parts are produced. This is achieved through a combination of AI-powered vision systems and other advanced technologies.

- **AI-Powered Vision Systems**: These systems use cameras to monitor the printing process in real-time, and they can be trained to detect a wide range of defects, such as layer shifts, spaghetti, and warping. When a defect is detected, the system can automatically stop the print and alert an operator.
- **Layer-by-Layer Monitoring**: Advanced systems can analyze each layer of the print as it is being deposited, and they can achieve a high degree of accuracy in recognizing issues like incorrect flow rates. This allows for the early detection of problems that might not be visible to the naked eye.
- **Predictive Quality Control**: By analyzing data from a large number of prints, it is possible to develop predictive models that can anticipate failures before they occur. This allows for proactive intervention, which can help to improve the overall quality and reliability of the production process.
- **3D Scanning Validation**: For parts with tight dimensional tolerances, 3D scanning can be used to validate the geometry of the finished part. Modern 3D scanners are capable of measuring millions of points per second, providing a high-resolution digital model of the part that can be compared to the original CAD file.
