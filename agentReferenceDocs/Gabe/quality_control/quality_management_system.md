# Quality Management System (QMS)

A quality management system (QMS) is a formalized system that documents processes, procedures, and responsibilities for achieving quality policies and objectives. A QMS helps to coordinate and direct an organizationâ€™s activities to meet customer and regulatory requirements and improve its effectiveness and efficiency on a continuous basis.
