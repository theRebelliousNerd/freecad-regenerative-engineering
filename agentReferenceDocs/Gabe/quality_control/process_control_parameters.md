# Process Control Parameters for Quality Assurance

Maintaining a consistent level of quality across thousands of prints requires a rigorous approach to process control. The following parameters are critical for ensuring the reliability and repeatability of the FDM mass production process.

- **Temperature Stability**: The temperature of the hotend and the heated bed must be tightly controlled, with a tolerance of no more than ±2°C. This is essential for consistent material extrusion and layer adhesion.
- **Humidity Control**: The relative humidity of the printing environment should be maintained between 20% and 40%. Many filaments are hygroscopic, meaning they absorb moisture from the air, which can lead to poor print quality and failed prints. All production filament should be stored in a sealed, desiccated environment.
- **Filament Diameter**: The diameter of the filament should be consistent, with a tolerance of no more than ±0.02 mm. Inconsistent filament diameter can lead to over-extrusion or under-extrusion, resulting in poor surface quality and dimensional inaccuracy.
- **Belt Tension**: For printers that use a belt-driven system, the tension of the belts should be checked and adjusted every 500 print hours. Loose belts can lead to backlash and other motion artifacts, resulting in poor print quality.
