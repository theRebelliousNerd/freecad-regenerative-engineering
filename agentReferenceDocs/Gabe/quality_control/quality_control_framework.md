# Quality Control Framework

## The Cost of Poor Quality

- **Direct Costs**: Material waste, machine time, labor
- **Indirect Costs**: Delays, damage to reputation, customer returns
- **Typical Failure Rates**: 5-15% without a QC process, <2% with a comprehensive QC process
- **ROI of Quality Systems**: 300-500% within the first year

## Quality Control Hierarchy

```
Level 1: Design Validation (Pre-Production)
├── DFM compliance checking
├── Simulation and FEA
└── Prototype validation

Level 2: Process Control (During Production)
├── Real-time monitoring
├── In-situ inspection
└── Automated intervention

Level 3: Product Inspection (Post-Production)
├── Dimensional verification
├── Surface quality assessment
└── Functional testing

Level 4: Continuous Improvement
├── Data analytics
├── Root cause analysis
└── Process optimization
```
