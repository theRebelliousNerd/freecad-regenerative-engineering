# Common Quality Issues and Solutions

This guide provides a list of common quality issues in 3D printing and their solutions.

## Issue: Layer Adhesion Problems
**Detection**: Visual inspection, mechanical testing
**Solution**: Increase the nozzle temperature, dry the filament, or reduce the print speed.

## Issue: Dimensional Inaccuracy
**Detection**: CMM measurement, go/no-go gauges
**Solution**: Calibrate the printer, compensate for shrinkage in the CAD model, or change the orientation of the part.

## Issue: Surface Defects
**Detection**: Vision system, visual inspection
**Solution**: Optimize the slicer settings, improve the support structures, or use a post-processing technique, such as sanding or vapor smoothing.

## Issue: Warping/Curling
**Detection**: Flatness measurement, visual inspection
**Solution**: Improve bed adhesion, use a heated chamber, or modify the design of the part.
