# In-Process Quality Control (2024-2025 Technologies)

In-process quality control is focused on detecting and correcting defects as they occur. This is achieved through a combination of real-time monitoring, process parameter monitoring, and environmental control.

## Real-Time Monitoring Systems

### Layer-by-Layer Inspection
**Technology**: Phase3D Fringe Qualification
- Structured light measurement
- Height map generation per layer
- Automatic defect detection
- Multi-printer simultaneous monitoring
- Real-time alerts and intervention

### AI-Powered Vision Systems
**Capabilities**:
- **QuinlyVision AI** (3DQue):
  - Spaghetti detection
  - Poor first layer identification
  - Stringing recognition
  - 94.7% accuracy in flow rate detection

**Implementation**:
```python
Quality Thresholds:
- First layer coverage: >95%
- Layer consistency: ±0.05mm
- Extrusion consistency: ±5%
- Surface defects: <2 per 100cm²
```

## Process Parameter Monitoring

### Critical Parameters to Track
| Parameter | Acceptable Range | Measurement Method | Action Threshold |
|---|---|---|---|
| Nozzle Temperature | ±2°C | Thermistor | ±5°C |
| Bed Temperature | ±3°C | Thermistor | ±5°C |
| Chamber Temperature | ±5°C | Thermometer | ±10°C |
| Filament Diameter | ±0.02mm | Laser sensor | ±0.05mm |
| Extrusion Rate | ±5% | Encoder | ±10% |
| Layer Height | ±0.02mm | Vision system | ±0.05mm |
| Print Speed | ±5% | Motor encoder | ±10% |

### Automated Response Protocols
```
IF deviation detected:
  1. Log event with timestamp
  2. Assess severity (minor/major/critical)
  3. If minor: Continue with monitoring
  4. If major: Adjust parameters in real-time
  5. If critical: Pause print and alert operator
  6. Document corrective action
```

## Environmental Control

### Optimal Conditions
- **Temperature**: 20-25°C ±2°C
- **Humidity**: 30-40% RH
- **Air flow**: Minimal, filtered
- **Vibration**: <0.1mm amplitude
- **Dust**: HEPA filtered environment

### Monitoring Equipment
- Temperature/humidity sensors: $50-200
- Particle counters: $500-2000
- Vibration monitors: $200-1000
- Environmental loggers: $100-500
