# Pre-Production Quality Assurance

Pre-production quality assurance is focused on preventing defects before they occur. This is achieved through a combination of design validation and first article inspection.

## Design Validation

### DFM Compliance Checklist
- [ ] Minimum wall thickness ≥1mm verified
- [ ] All overhangs ≤45° or chamfered
- [ ] Support structures eliminated where possible
- [ ] First layer geometry optimized
- [ ] Tolerances appropriate for FDM process
- [ ] Material selection validated
- [ ] Orientation optimized for strength/quality
- [ ] Cost targets achievable

### Simulation and Analysis
```
Required Validations:
1. Printability analysis (overhang, support needs)
2. Structural FEA (load cases, safety factors)
3. Thermal analysis (warping prediction)
4. Time/cost estimation
5. Tolerance stack-up analysis
```

## First Article Inspection (FAI)

### FAI Protocol
1. **Print validation samples** (minimum 3-5 pieces)
2. **Dimensional inspection** (CMM or optical)
3. **Surface quality assessment**
4. **Functional testing** (if applicable)
5. **Destructive testing** (one sample)
6. **Document results** and approve for production

### Critical Dimensions Measurement
```
Measurement Tools:
- Calipers: ±0.02mm accuracy
- Micrometers: ±0.001mm accuracy
- CMM: ±0.005mm accuracy
- Optical scanners: ±0.05mm accuracy
- CT scanning: Internal features
```
