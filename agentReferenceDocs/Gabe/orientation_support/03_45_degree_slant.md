# 2.2. The 45-Degree Slant: A Deep Dive into Self-Supporting Geometries

The most powerful strategy for eliminating slicer-generated supports is to design parts that are inherently self-supporting. This is achieved by leveraging the natural capability of the FDM process.

## Core Concept

An FDM printer can deposit a new layer as long as it has sufficient overlap with the layer below. The generally accepted limit for this is an overhang angle of 45 degrees from the vertical. Any angle steeper than this risks the filament being deposited into mid-air, causing drooping or failure. The core DFAM strategy, therefore, is to orient the entire part on the build plate at a 45-degree angle. By doing so, many features that would be severe overhangs or horizontal bridges in a flat orientation become printable 45-degree slopes.

## Benefits

This slanted orientation offers a trifecta of benefits that are critical for mass production:

1. **Support Elimination:** It drastically reduces or completely eliminates the need for slicer-generated support material, thereby removing the associated material cost, print time, and post-processing labor.
2. **Improved Surface Finish:** Aesthetically important surfaces can be oriented facing upwards, away from any potential support contact, resulting in a clean finish straight off the printer without any scarring.
3. **Enhanced Strength:** The layer lines are oriented diagonally relative to the part's main axes. This means that stresses applied along the conventional X, Y, or Z axes are distributed across the layers rather than acting directly between them, resulting in a stronger, more isotropic part.
