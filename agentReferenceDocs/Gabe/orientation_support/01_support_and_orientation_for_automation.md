# Mastering Supports and Orientation for Automated Production

In mass production, efficiency is paramount. Any step that requires manual labor or introduces a point of failure is a direct threat to profitability and scalability. Traditional, slicer-generated support structures are a primary source of both. The DFAM approach seeks to eliminate this liability by fundamentally rethinking how parts are oriented and supported, transferring process intelligence from the generic slicer algorithm directly into the bespoke geometry of the CAD model.
