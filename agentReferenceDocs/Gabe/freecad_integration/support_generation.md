# Support Structure Generation

While the goal of DFAM is to eliminate supports, there are some cases where they are unavoidable. In these cases, it is important to optimize the support structures to minimize material usage, print time, and post-processing labor.

## Tree Support Generator

Tree supports are a type of support structure that is generated using a branching algorithm. They use significantly less material than traditional supports, and they are often easier to remove.

```python
# Advanced Support Generation
class TreeSupportGenerator:
    def __init__(self, part):
        self.part = part
        self.overhang_faces = []
        self.support_points = []
        
    def identify_overhangs(self, angle_threshold=45):
        """Find faces requiring support"""
        for face in self.part.Shape.Faces:
            normal = face.normalAt(0.5, 0.5)
            z_angle = normal.getAngle(App.Vector(0, 0, -1))
            if z_angle < angle_threshold * (3.14159/180):
                self.overhang_faces.append(face)
    
    def generate_tree_supports(self):
        """Create tree-like support structures"""
        for face in self.overhang_faces:
            # Calculate support point
            center = face.CenterOfMass
            support_base = App.Vector(center.x, center.y, 0)
            
            # Create organic tree path
            trunk = Part.makeLine(support_base, center)
            
            # Add branches if needed
            if face.Area > 100:  # Large overhang
                branches = self.create_branches(face)
                trunk = trunk.fuse(branches)
            
            self.support_points.append(trunk)
    
    def export_supports(self):
        """Export support structures as separate body"""
        compound = Part.makeCompound(self.support_points)
        Part.show(compound, "TreeSupports")
        return compound
```
