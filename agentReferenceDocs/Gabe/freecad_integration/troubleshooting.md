# Troubleshooting Common Issues

This guide provides solutions to common issues that may be encountered when using FreeCAD in a mass production 3D printing environment.

## Issue: Slow Performance with Complex Models
**Solution**: Use simplified representations for visualization, and full detail for export.

## Issue: DFAM Violations Not Detected
**Solution**: Implement a comprehensive mesh analysis in addition to the shape analysis.

## Issue: Inconsistent Export Quality
**Solution**: Standardize the mesh resolution settings and validate the export before slicing.

## Issue: Parameter Changes Break Model
**Solution**: Implement robust parameter validation and constraints.
