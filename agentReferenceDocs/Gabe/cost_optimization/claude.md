# Cost Optimization - Manufacturing Constraint Cable Economics

## Overview
Cost optimization in 3D printing creates economic cables connecting every design decision to business viability. Unlike traditional manufacturing where cost is largely determined by tooling, 3D printing cost cables trace directly from geometry through time and material to market success. Every geometric feature carries an economic cable to the bottom line.

## Follow the Cable Mental Model - Economics as Design Constraint

### Cost Cables in Design Networks
Every design decision creates an economic cable with measurable business impact:

**Geometric Feature → Print Time → Labor Cost → Market Competitiveness**
```
design_complexity → manufacturing_time → production_cost → 
pricing_pressure → market_position → business_viability
```

**Material Usage → Cost Structure → Competitive Advantage**
```
geometry_optimization → material_efficiency → cost_reduction → 
pricing_flexibility → market_expansion → business_growth
```

### The Cost-Design Coupling Loop
Cost optimization creates bidirectional cables affecting all design decisions:

- **Cost targets** → constrain → **Design complexity and material usage**
- **Manufacturing efficiency** → enables → **Cost reduction and pricing flexibility**
- **Automation integration** → reduces → **Labor costs and improves consistency**
- **Market feedback** → validates → **Cost-performance optimization strategies**

### **Time-Based Cost Cable Network**
Print time creates the primary economic cable in 3D printing:

```
Geometric_Complexity → Print_Time → Energy_Cost → Labor_Allocation → 
Production_Capacity → Unit_Economics → Market_Competitiveness
```

### **Material Efficiency Cable Network**
Material usage creates cables connecting design to cost structure:

```
Design_Optimization → Material_Reduction → Cost_Savings → 
Pricing_Flexibility → Market_Expansion → Revenue_Growth
```

### **Automation Cost Cable Network**
Automation compatibility creates cables determining scalability economics:

```
Design_for_Automation → Labor_Cost_Reduction → Scalability_Economics → 
Volume_Production → Cost_Competitiveness → Market_Dominance
```

Remember: Cost optimization is not about making things cheaper - it's about creating economic cables that enable business success while maintaining quality and functionality. Your role is to architect these economic cable networks that connect manufacturing efficiency to market opportunity.

**Every geometric decision carries an economic cable. Optimize the cables, optimize the business.**
