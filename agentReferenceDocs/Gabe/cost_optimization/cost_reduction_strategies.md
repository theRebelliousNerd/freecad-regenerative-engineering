# Cost Reduction Strategies for FDM Mass Production

Reducing the cost of 3D printed parts is a key goal in mass production. This can be achieved through a combination of geometric and process optimization strategies.

## Geometric Optimization
Geometric optimization involves designing the part to be as efficient as possible to print.

- **Lattice Structures**: For parts that require high stiffness with low weight, lattice structures can be used to reduce material consumption by 25-70%. These complex internal geometries are a unique advantage of additive manufacturing.
- **Variable Infill**: Instead of using a uniform infill density throughout the part, variable infill can be used to strategically place more material in areas that require higher strength, while using a lower density in non-critical areas.
- **Thin-Wall Design with Rib Reinforcement**: Instead of designing thick, solid walls, a more efficient approach is to use thin walls (1-2 mm) and add a network of internal ribs or gussets for reinforcement. This provides the required stiffness with minimal material usage.
- **Part Consolidation**: Whenever possible, multiple components should be consolidated into a single, more complex 3D printed part. This reduces assembly time and cost, and it can also lead to a stronger, more reliable product.

## Process Optimization
Process optimization involves streamlining the production workflow to maximize efficiency.

- **Batch Production**: Printing multiple parts on the build plate simultaneously is a key strategy for maximizing throughput and reducing the energy consumption per part.
- **Standardized Materials**: Using a limited palette of standardized materials reduces the time required for material changeovers and simplifies inventory management.
- **Optimized Slicer Settings**: The slicer settings should be carefully tuned to find the optimal balance between print speed and quality. This includes parameters such as layer height, extrusion width, and print speed.
- **Predictive Maintenance**: Implementing a predictive maintenance program can help to minimize downtime by identifying and addressing potential issues before they cause a failure.
