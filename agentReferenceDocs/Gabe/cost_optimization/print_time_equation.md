# The Print Time Cost Equation
*Mathematical Optimization of Manufacturing Economics*

## The Fundamental Economic Truth of FDM

**In FDM manufacturing, time IS money in the most direct way possible.**

Unlike injection molding where tooling dominates cost, or CNC where material waste is significant, FDM cost is almost entirely a function of machine time. This creates unprecedented power for the design engineer to directly control manufacturing economics.

## The Print Time Mathematical Model

### Primary Time Components
```python
def calculate_total_print_time(part_geometry, print_settings):
    """Calculate total time for FDM part production"""
    
    # Core printing time (dominant factor)
    extrusion_time = calculate_extrusion_time(part_geometry, print_settings)
    
    # Movement time (travel between features)
    travel_time = calculate_travel_time(part_geometry, print_settings)
    
    # Layer transition time (Z-axis moves)
    layer_time = part_geometry.layer_count * print_settings.layer_transition_time
    
    # Acceleration/deceleration time (corners and direction changes)
    acceleration_time = calculate_acceleration_penalties(part_geometry)
    
    # Cooling/waiting time (minimum layer times, bridges)
    cooling_time = calculate_cooling_delays(part_geometry, print_settings)
    
    total_time = (extrusion_time + travel_time + layer_time + 
                  acceleration_time + cooling_time)
    
    return total_time
```

### The Z-Height Dominance Principle
**Layer count is the primary cost driver**

```
PRINT TIME BREAKDOWN:
Component               Typical %    Design Control
Extrusion time         60-70%       HIGH (volume, perimeters)
Layer transitions      15-25%       ABSOLUTE (Z-height)
Travel moves           10-15%       MODERATE (geometry optimization)
Acceleration losses    5-10%        HIGH (corner rounding)
Cooling delays         2-8%         MODERATE (overhang design)

KEY INSIGHT: Z-height reduction has exponential impact
```

### Z-Height Cost Function
```python
def calculate_z_height_cost_impact(original_height, reduced_height):
    """Calculate cost reduction from Z-height optimization"""
    
    layer_height = 0.2  # Standard layer height
    
    original_layers = original_height / layer_height
    reduced_layers = reduced_height / layer_height
    
    # Layer transition time (includes Z-move, acceleration, settling)
    layer_transition_time = 2.5  # seconds per layer typical
    
    time_savings = (original_layers - reduced_layers) * layer_transition_time
    
    # Additional savings from reduced extrusion time
    volume_reduction = calculate_volume_reduction(original_height, reduced_height)
    extrusion_time_savings = volume_reduction / extrusion_rate
    
    total_time_savings = time_savings + extrusion_time_savings
    cost_savings_percentage = (total_time_savings / original_print_time) * 100
    
    return cost_savings_percentage
```

## Geometric Optimization Strategies

### Strategy 1: Diagonal Orientation Magic
**The most powerful single optimization technique**

#### The Mathematical Advantage
```
DIAGONAL ORIENTATION BENEFITS:
Rectangular part: 100mm × 50mm × 20mm

Standard orientation:
- Print height: 20mm
- Layer count: 100 layers (0.2mm layers)
- Layer transition time: 250 seconds

45° diagonal orientation:
- Print height: √(100² + 50²) = 111.8mm diagonal < 100+50 = 150mm
- Effective height: ~15mm (depends on exact geometry)
- Layer count: 75 layers
- Layer transition time: 187.5 seconds
- Time savings: 25% just from orientation change
```

#### Diagonal Orientation Implementation
```python
def optimize_diagonal_orientation(part_geometry):
    """Find optimal diagonal orientation for minimum Z-height"""
    
    # Test all rotational orientations in 5° increments
    best_orientation = None
    min_z_height = float('inf')
    
    for rotation_x in range(0, 180, 5):
        for rotation_y in range(0, 180, 5):
            # Apply rotation and calculate bounding box
            rotated_geometry = rotate_part(part_geometry, rotation_x, rotation_y)
            z_height = calculate_z_height(rotated_geometry)
            
            # Check for support requirements in this orientation
            support_volume = calculate_support_requirement(rotated_geometry)
            
            # Calculate total cost including support penalty
            total_cost = calculate_total_print_cost(z_height, support_volume)
            
            if total_cost < min_cost and validate_printability(rotated_geometry):
                best_orientation = (rotation_x, rotation_y)
                min_z_height = z_height
    
    return best_orientation, min_z_height
```

### Strategy 2: Volume Optimization Through Design
**Internal structure optimization for speed and strength**

#### Infill vs Solid Trade-offs
```
VOLUME OPTIMIZATION ANALYSIS:
Solid part (100% fill):
- Maximum strength
- Maximum print time  
- Maximum material cost
- Thermal stress issues

20% Gyroid infill:
- 85% of solid strength (compressive)
- 30% of print time
- 25% of material cost
- Better thermal properties
- Internal support structure

Optimal strategy: Solid only where needed, infill everywhere else
```

#### Strategic Solid Regions
```python
def optimize_infill_distribution(part_geometry, load_analysis):
    """Optimize infill density based on stress distribution"""
    
    stress_map = load_analysis.get_stress_distribution()
    
    for region in part_geometry.get_regions():
        local_stress = stress_map.get_stress_at_region(region)
        
        if local_stress > material.yield_strength * 0.7:
            region.set_infill_density(100)  # Solid for high stress
        elif local_stress > material.yield_strength * 0.4:
            region.set_infill_density(40)   # Dense infill for moderate stress
        else:
            region.set_infill_density(15)   # Light infill for low stress
    
    return optimized_infill_pattern
```

### Strategy 3: Perimeter Optimization
**Minimize wall printing time while maintaining strength**

#### Perimeter Count Optimization
```
PERIMETER STRATEGY:
Single perimeter (0.4mm): Fast but weak
- Use for: Non-structural internal features
- Time impact: Baseline

Double perimeter (0.8mm): Standard strong
- Use for: Most structural applications  
- Time impact: +100% perimeter time

Triple perimeter (1.2mm): Maximum strength
- Use for: Critical load-bearing features only
- Time impact: +200% perimeter time

Variable perimeter design: Optimize locally
```

## Advanced Cost Optimization Techniques

### Print Speed Optimization
**Balancing speed with quality and reliability**

#### Speed vs Quality Trade-off Function
```python
def optimize_print_speed(quality_requirements, reliability_targets):
    """Calculate optimal print speed for cost/quality balance"""
    
    base_speed = 50  # mm/s baseline
    
    # Quality impact function (exponential relationship)
    quality_factor = calculate_quality_degradation(print_speed)
    
    # Reliability impact (failure rate increases with speed)  
    failure_rate = calculate_failure_rate(print_speed, part_geometry)
    
    # Total cost including failures and rework
    total_cost = (print_time_cost + failure_cost + quality_penalty_cost)
    
    # Find minimum total cost speed
    optimal_speed = minimize_total_cost(total_cost)
    
    return optimal_speed
```

#### Speed Optimization by Feature Type
```json
{
  "speed_optimization_strategy": {
    "perimeters": {
      "external": "30mm/s (quality critical)",
      "internal": "60mm/s (speed priority)", 
      "overhangs": "25mm/s (reliability critical)"
    },
    "infill": {
      "structural": "80mm/s (fastest safe speed)",
      "support": "60mm/s (balance speed/quality)"
    },
    "bridges": "15mm/s (cooling critical)",
    "first_layer": "20mm/s (adhesion critical)",
    "small_features": "40mm/s (prevent over-heating)"
  }
}
```

### Nesting and Batching Optimization
**Maximize build plate utilization**

#### Plate Packing Algorithm
```python
def optimize_plate_packing(parts_list, build_plate_dimensions):
    """Optimize part arrangement for maximum throughput"""
    
    # Sort parts by height (print tall parts together)
    height_sorted_parts = sort_by_height(parts_list)
    
    # Calculate optimal spacing (clearance + support access)
    spacing_requirements = calculate_spacing_needs(parts_list)
    
    # 2D bin packing optimization
    packing_solutions = []
    
    for arrangement in generate_packing_arrangements(height_sorted_parts):
        plate_utilization = calculate_utilization(arrangement)
        print_time = calculate_batch_print_time(arrangement)
        part_quality = assess_arrangement_quality_impact(arrangement)
        
        efficiency_score = (plate_utilization * part_quality) / print_time
        packing_solutions.append((arrangement, efficiency_score))
    
    return select_optimal_arrangement(packing_solutions)
```

#### Multi-Height Batching Strategy
```
BATCH OPTIMIZATION RULES:
Same height parts: Ideal batching (no time penalty)
Mixed height parts: Penalty from tallest part dominates

Strategy:
1. Group parts by similar heights (±20% tolerance)
2. Fill remaining space with shorter parts if advantageous
3. Calculate break-even point for mixed vs separate batches

Example:
Batch A: 10 parts @ 20mm height = 100 layers
Adding 1 part @ 40mm height = 200 layers (100% time increase)
Decision: Only add tall part if it would take >50% of batch time alone
```

## Cost Analysis and Modeling

### Direct Cost Components
```python
class FDMCostModel:
    """Comprehensive FDM cost calculation model"""
    
    def __init__(self, machine_rate_per_hour, material_cost_per_kg):
        self.machine_rate = machine_rate_per_hour  # $/hour
        self.material_cost = material_cost_per_kg  # $/kg
        self.labor_rate = 25  # $/hour for manual operations
        
    def calculate_part_cost(self, part):
        # Direct machine time cost
        print_time_hours = part.print_time / 3600
        machine_cost = print_time_hours * self.machine_rate
        
        # Material cost
        part_mass_kg = part.volume * material.density / 1000
        material_cost = part_mass_kg * self.material_cost
        
        # Support material cost (if any)
        support_cost = part.support_volume * material.density * self.material_cost / 1000
        
        # Labor cost (support removal, post-processing)
        labor_time_hours = part.labor_time / 3600
        labor_cost = labor_time_hours * self.labor_rate
        
        # Failure cost (expected cost of failures)
        failure_cost = (machine_cost + material_cost) * part.failure_rate
        
        total_cost = machine_cost + material_cost + support_cost + labor_cost + failure_cost
        return total_cost
```

### Cost Sensitivity Analysis
```
COST SENSITIVITY RANKING:
1. Print time (Z-height): 1% height reduction = 1-2% cost reduction
2. Support volume: 1% support reduction = 0.5-1% cost reduction  
3. Part volume: 1% volume reduction = 0.2-0.5% cost reduction
4. Print speed: 1% speed increase = 0.8-1% cost reduction
5. Failure rate: 1% failure reduction = 0.1-0.3% cost reduction

Focus optimization efforts in order of sensitivity
```

## Production Scaling Economics

### Volume Break-Even Analysis
```python
def calculate_volume_break_even(setup_cost, marginal_cost_reduction, volume):
    """Calculate when design optimization investment pays off"""
    
    # One-time design optimization cost
    optimization_cost = setup_cost
    
    # Per-part savings from optimization
    savings_per_part = marginal_cost_reduction
    
    # Break-even volume
    break_even_volume = optimization_cost / savings_per_part
    
    if volume > break_even_volume:
        return "OPTIMIZATION_WORTHWHILE"
    else:
        return "USE_STANDARD_DESIGN"
```

### Scaling Factor Impact
```
VOLUME-BASED OPTIMIZATION PRIORITY:
Low Volume (1-100 parts):
- Focus on design time minimization
- Use standard orientations and settings
- Accept moderate inefficiency for speed

Medium Volume (100-10,000 parts):  
- Optimize major cost drivers (Z-height, supports)
- Custom print profiles worth the setup time
- Consider part splitting for efficiency

High Volume (10,000+ parts):
- Optimize every measurable cost factor
- Custom tooling/fixtures worth investment
- Design multiple variants for different applications
```

## Quality-Cost Optimization

### The Quality-Speed-Cost Triangle
```python
def optimize_quality_speed_cost(requirements):
    """Find optimal balance between competing objectives"""
    
    # Define objective function weights
    cost_weight = requirements.cost_priority
    speed_weight = requirements.delivery_priority  
    quality_weight = requirements.quality_priority
    
    # Generate Pareto frontier of solutions
    solutions = []
    
    for speed in speed_range:
        for quality_settings in quality_range:
            cost = calculate_cost(speed, quality_settings)
            quality_score = calculate_quality_score(speed, quality_settings)
            time_score = calculate_time_score(speed, quality_settings)
            
            # Multi-objective optimization
            total_score = (cost_weight * cost + 
                          speed_weight * time_score + 
                          quality_weight * quality_score)
            
            solutions.append((speed, quality_settings, total_score))
    
    return pareto_optimal_solutions(solutions)
```

### Design Validation Economics

  "validation_cost_analysis": {
    "prototype_cost": "$50-200 per design iteration",
    "design_time_cost": "$100-500 per iteration cycle",

### ROI Calculation for Design Optimization
```python
def calculate_optimization_roi(current_cost, optimized_cost, 
                              optimization_effort_hours, production_volume):
    """Calculate return on investment for design optimization"""
    
    cost_savings_per_part = current_cost - optimized_cost
    total_savings = cost_savings_per_part * production_volume
    
    optimization_cost = optimization_effort_hours * engineer_hourly_rate
    
    roi_percentage = ((total_savings - optimization_cost) / optimization_cost) * 100
    payback_volume = optimization_cost / cost_savings_per_part
    
    return {
        "roi_percentage": roi_percentage,
        "payback_volume": payback_volume,
        "total_savings": total_savings,
        "optimization_worthwhile": roi_percentage > 200  # 200% ROI threshold
    }
```

**Remember: Every second saved in print time multiplies across every part in production. Master the print time equation, and you master the economics of additive manufacturing.**
