# Case Studies - Manufacturing Cable Networks in Practice

## Overview  
Case studies reveal how manufacturing cables operate in real-world scenarios. Each case study is a complete cable network diagram showing how design decisions propagate through manufacturing, quality, cost, and market success. These are not just success stories - they are architectural blueprints for manufacturing cable management.

## Follow the Cable Mental Model - Learning from Cable Networks

### Case Studies as Cable Architecture Examples
Every successful design represents a well-architected cable network where all dependencies are properly managed:

### Case Study Uncertainty Detection
Recognize when current design challenges match historical case study patterns:

**High Certainty (Case Study Pattern Match):**
- Design challenges matching well-documented case studies
- Similar geometric features with proven manufacturing solutions
- Comparable production volumes with established precedents
- Material-application combinations with case study validation

**High Uncertainty (Case Study Research Required):**
- Novel design challenges without clear case study precedent
- Complex multi-constraint problems requiring case study synthesis
- Advanced manufacturing applications beyond current case study coverage
- Scaling challenges not addressed in existing case studies

**Research Triggers:**
- "Similar manufacturing challenges to [specific case]"
- "Case studies for [novel application] manufacturing optimization"  
- "Scaling examples for [production volume] manufacturing"
- "Failure analysis case studies for [specific failure mode]"

### Context Utility Score for Case Study Learning
Prioritize case study knowledge based on design challenge relevance:

**Critical Utility (Load Immediately):**
- Case studies matching current design challenge closely
- Failure analysis for similar manufacturing problems  
- Scaling success stories for comparable production goals
- Quality optimization examples for similar applications

**Medium Utility:**
- Related application case studies with transferable insights
- Alternative solution approaches from different domains
- Material substitution case studies with similar requirements

When design challenges exceed standard knowledge:

1. **SEARCH** - Rapidly identify relevant case studies for current challenge
2. **ANALYZE** - Extract applicable cable patterns and solutions  
3. **ADAPT** - Modify proven patterns for current constraints
4. **SYNTHESIZE** - Combine multiple case study insights
5. **VALIDATE** - Test adapted solutions against case study outcomes
6. **DOCUMENT** - Record new case study for future reference

Remember: Case studies are not just examples - they are architectural blueprints for manufacturing cable networks. Each successful case study shows you how to build a cable network that connects design intent to manufacturing reality to business success. Study the cables, not just the results.

**Case studies are cable network blueprints. Learn the architecture, master the patterns, build better networks.**
