# Nesting and Batching: Maximizing Production Throughput

## The Principle of Batch Production
In a mass production environment, the goal is to maximize the number of parts produced per unit of time. A significant portion of the total production time is consumed by non-printing overhead, such as the printer heating up, performing calibration routines, and cooling down. Batching, or printing multiple parts on the build plate simultaneously, is a critical strategy for minimizing this overhead and maximizing efficiency.

## Nesting Strategies
Nesting is the process of arranging multiple parts on the build plate to maximize the use of the available space. Effective nesting can significantly increase the number of parts per batch, leading to a corresponding increase in throughput.

- **Interlocking Geometries**: Designing parts with complementary geometries that allow them to be tightly packed together is a key nesting strategy. This can involve creating features that allow parts to slot into one another, much like a puzzle.
- **Minimize Non-Printing Moves**: The arrangement of parts on the build plate should be optimized to minimize the travel time of the print head between parts. This is typically handled by the slicer software, but the initial placement of parts can have a significant impact.
- **Increased Throughput**: By printing more parts in a single batch, the overall throughput of the print farm can be increased by 50-70%.
- **Reduced Energy Consumption**: Printing a full bed of parts is more energy-efficient than printing the same number of parts one at a time, as the energy cost of heating the bed and hotend is amortized over a larger number of parts.
