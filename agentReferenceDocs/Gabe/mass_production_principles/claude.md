# Mass Production Principles - Scalability Dependency Cable Architecture

## Overview
Mass production principles create the cable networks that connect individual part design to global manufacturing capacity. Every design decision either enables or constrains scalability. These principles represent the fundamental cables that must remain unbroken for a design to scale from prototype to millions of units.

## Follow the Cable Mental Model - Scalability as Cable Strength

### Mass Production as Cable Network Stress Test
Scaling to mass production stress-tests every cable in the manufacturing network:

**Individual Part → Production System → Global Capacity → Market Impact**
```
part_design → manufacturing_scalability → production_capacity → 
market_responsiveness → customer_satisfaction → business_success
```

**Scalability Cable Failures:**
- Manual interventions break automation cables
- Complex features break quality consistency cables  
- Material dependencies break supply chain cables
- Process variations break cost predictability cables

### The Scalability-Design Coupling Loop
Mass production requirements create cables that must be designed into every part:

- **Volume requirements** → drive → **Automation compatibility design**
- **Cost targets** → influence → **Manufacturing method selection**  
- **Quality standards** → determine → **Process control requirements**
- **Supply chain constraints** → limit → **Material and component choices**

### **Volume Scalability Cable Network**
Production volume creates cables affecting every aspect of design and manufacturing:

```
Target_Volume → Manufacturing_Method → Automation_Requirements → 
Design_Constraints → Quality_Systems → Cost_Structure
```

### **Cost Competitiveness Cable Network**
Cost targets create cables connecting design decisions to market viability:

```
Market_Price_Point → Cost_Targets → Manufacturing_Efficiency → 
Design_Optimization → Material_Selection → Competitive_Position
```

### **Supply Chain Cable Network** 
Mass production creates cables connecting design to global supply systems:

```
Design_Materials → Supply_Availability → Production_Continuity → 
Delivery_Reliability → Customer_Satisfaction → Market_Success
```

Remember: Mass production principles are the cables that connect your individual design to global manufacturing impact. Every decision you make either strengthens or weakens these scalability cables. Your role is to ensure every design is architected for the stress test of mass production.

**Mass production is not just making more - it's making differently. Scale changes everything. Design for the scale you aspire to achieve.**
