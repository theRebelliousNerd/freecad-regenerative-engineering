# High-Speed Printing: Balancing Throughput and Quality

## High-Speed FDM Parameters (2024-2025 Standards)
Achieving high-speed printing in a production environment is a trade-off between raw velocity and the physical limitations of thermoplastic extrusion. While modern printers are capable of extremely high speeds, production-grade quality requires a more nuanced approach.

- **Standard Production Speed**: 40-150 mm/s. This range is the workhorse of most print farms, offering a reliable balance of speed and quality.
- **High-Speed Systems**: Capable of speeds up to 500 mm/s with acceleration rates of 20,000 mm/sÂ². These are typically used for specific applications where speed is the absolute priority and some quality trade-offs are acceptable.
- **Optimal Production Speed**: 80-120 mm/s. This is the sweet spot for mass production, maximizing throughput while maintaining high-quality surface finish and dimensional accuracy.

## Cooling Strategies for High-Speed Production
The amount of cooling applied to a print is material-dependent and critical for layer adhesion and dimensional stability at high speeds.

- **PLA**: Requires maximum cooling. The goal is to solidify the extruded plastic as quickly as possible to prevent drooping and maintain sharp details.
- **ABS**: Requires minimal cooling. This helps to prevent warping and cracking by maintaining a more consistent temperature throughout the part.
- **PETG**: Requires moderate cooling. This provides a balance between good layer adhesion and preventing stringing.
- **Minimum Layer Time**: A critical parameter that ensures each layer has enough time to cool and solidify before the next one is applied. A typical value is 5-10 seconds. For small parts, the printer will automatically slow down to meet this requirement.

## Diagonal Printing Strategy: The Zero-Cost Optimization
A powerful technique for reducing print time and increasing throughput without any hardware changes is to orient the part diagonally on the build plate.

### Benefits
- **Reduced Z-Height**: Orienting a rectangular part at a 45-degree angle can reduce its overall Z-height by up to 40%. Since print time is directly proportional to Z-height, this can result in a significant time savings.
- **Decreased Print Time**: A 40% reduction in Z-height can lead to a 25-35% reduction in overall print time.
- **Improved Bed Utilization**: Diagonal orientation allows for more efficient packing of parts on the build plate, increasing the number of parts per batch.
- **Larger Parts**: This technique can enable the printing of parts that would otherwise be too large to fit within the build volume.
