# The Slant 3D Methodology

This guide extensively analyzes and builds upon the methodology employed by Slant 3D, a company that operates one of the world's largest 3D printing farms. Their approach is revolutionary in its conceptualization of the production floor. A print farm is not treated as a mere collection of individual machines but as a single, cohesive manufacturing systemâ€”a "Digital Warehouse". In this model, physical inventory is replaced by digital files stored on a server, ready to be materialized on demand. This systemic perspective informs every design decision, from the curve of a corner to the angle of an overhang.

By conceptualizing a print farm as a "Digital Warehouse," the entire economic and logistical framework of manufacturing is transformed. This model decouples production from the traditional constraints that define injection molding, such as exorbitant tooling costs, long lead times for mold fabrication, Minimum Order Quantities (MOQs), and the financial burden of warehousing physical inventory. This strategic decoupling makes on-demand manufacturing services, such as Slant 3D's Teleport platform, possible. A designer can progress from a final CAD model to a saleable product almost instantaneously because the design file itself functions as the "tooling," and the "inventory" is weightless and digital. DFAM, in this context, transcends being a set of engineering guidelines to become a powerful strategic tool. It enables unprecedented business agility, facilitates rapid product iteration based on real-time market feedback, and dramatically reduces the financial risk associated with bringing a new physical product to market.
