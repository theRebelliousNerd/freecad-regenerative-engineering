# Advanced Geometries and Feature Design

Beyond the foundational principles that govern the overall structure of a part, mastering DFAM for production requires a nuanced understanding of how to design smaller, more complex features. This includes the strategic use of edge treatments, the engineering of robust enclosures, and the creation of reliable closures and mechanisms. These advanced techniques are where the theoretical principles are translated into functional, high-quality products.
