# Designing Robust Enclosures: Lugs, Bosses, and Ribs

While FDM frees designers from many of the constraints of injection molding, certain DFM principles for creating strong, functional enclosures remain highly relevant and should be incorporated into DFAM workflows.

* **Lugs and Lips:** To ensure the two halves of an enclosure align perfectly and resist shear forces, it is essential to design interlocking features. A common and effective method is a tongue-and-groove system, often referred to as a lip or lug, that runs along the seam of the enclosure. These features are simple to model and dramatically increase the strength and precision of the final assembly.
* **Bosses for Fasteners:** Driving a screw directly into a flat wall of an FDM-printed part is poor practice. The localized stress from the fastener can easily cause the layers to split or the wall to bulge and crack. The proper method is to design a screw bossâ€”a hollow cylindrical feature that protrudes from the wall. The boss reinforces the area around the hole, distributing the compressive and hoop stresses from the screw over a larger volume of material. A good rule of thumb is to make the outer diameter of the boss at least twice the nominal diameter of the screw.
* **Ribs and Gussets:** Large, flat walls on an enclosure can be prone to flexing. While FDM parts are not as susceptible to the sink marks that plague thick sections in injection molding, adding excessive material is still inefficient. A more effective solution is to add a network of thin internal ribs or triangular gussets. These features add significant rigidity and stiffness to the wall with minimal material and print time, following the same principles of structural engineering used in traditional manufacturing.
