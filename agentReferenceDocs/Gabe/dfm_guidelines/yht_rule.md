# The YHT Rule for Support Assessment

The YHT rule is a quick visual assessment that can be used to determine whether a feature will require support.

- **Y-Shaped Features**: Features that are shaped like the letter "Y" are always printable without support. The arms of the "Y" are at a 45-degree angle or less, which is within the self-supporting range of most FDM printers.
- **H-Shaped Features**: Features that are shaped like the letter "H" have a bridge in the middle, which is generally support-free. The length of the bridge should be kept under 10mm for best results.
- **T-Shaped Features**: Features that are shaped like the letter "T" will require support or a design modification. The arms of the "T" are at a 90-degree angle, which is too steep to be printed without support.
