# Orientation Analysis Tools

A number of software tools are available to help with the analysis and optimization of part orientation.

## Software Solutions

- **Slicing Software Analysis**:
  - **Cura**: Has a built-in overhang visualization tool.
  - **PrusaSlicer**: Has a support painting feature that allows you to manually add or remove supports.
  - **Simplify3D**: Has an automated orientation feature that can be used to find the optimal orientation for a part.
- **Meshmixer**: Has an orientation optimization tool that can be used to find the orientation that minimizes support volume, print time, or a combination of factors.
- **Fusion 360**: Has an integrated analysis tool that can be used to perform stress analysis and other simulations.

## Strength Validation Methods

- **FEA Integration**:
  1. Export the oriented model from your CAD software.
  2. Apply boundary conditions and load cases.
  3. Run a stress analysis to identify areas of high stress.
  4. Verify that the layer orientation is appropriate for the stress distribution.
  5. Iterate on the orientation as needed to optimize the strength of the part.
