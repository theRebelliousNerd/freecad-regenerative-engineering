# The Core Philosophy of DFAM for Production

The central tenet of production-level DFAM is that the part must be designed with an intimate and holistic understanding of the entire additive manufacturing process—from the initial extrusion of filament to the final, automated ejection of the finished part from the build plate. In traditional injection molding, the part's geometry is finalized, and then a complex, expensive tool is engineered to create it. In FDM mass production, the part's geometry is engineered to be perfectly compatible with the printing, support, and automation systems. The design is not just for the final product; it is for the seamless, repeatable, and cost-efficient operation of the manufacturing system itself.

The primary obstacles to scaling FDM are not rooted in the inherent speed of the printing process itself, but rather in the cumulative effect of manual interventions and the potential for cascading failures. At the scale of thousands of printers operating 24/7, a process that requires even a few minutes of manual labor per part—such as support removal or part harvesting—becomes economically untenable. Similarly, a print failure rate that might be acceptable for a single machine becomes a catastrophic loss of productivity and material across a large farm. Therefore, the design rules and principles outlined in this guide are not merely suggestions for achieving "good prints"; they are non-negotiable engineering requirements for economic viability at scale. The design must actively eliminate these manual touchpoints and failure modes at the CAD level, engineering reliability and automation directly into the part's geometry.
