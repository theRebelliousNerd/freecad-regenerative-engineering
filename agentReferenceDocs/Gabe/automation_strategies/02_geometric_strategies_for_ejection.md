# 3.2. Geometric Strategies: Domed Bottoms, Chamfered Edges, and Minimal Contact

While hardware provides the mechanism for ejection, the part's geometry determines whether that mechanism will succeed. A part with a large, flat bottom surface creates a strong vacuum-like bond with the build plate due to surface tension and atmospheric pressure, often requiring significant force to break. Attempting to push such a part off with the print head is likely to cause the stepper motors to skip steps, leading to a loss of calibration and system failure.

## The Solution: Minimize Contact Area

The fundamental design principle for auto-ejection is to minimize the surface area of the part's first layer. A key technique demonstrated by Slant 3D involves replacing a flat bottom with a very shallow dome. This seemingly minor change has a profound effect. The part no longer rests on a large, flat plane but instead makes contact with the build plate at a single, near-tangential point or a very small ring. This drastically reduces the adhesion force, allowing the part to be "popped" off the bed with very little effort from the ejection mechanism. The part is now engineered to be reliably removed, eliminating the risk of it sticking to the machine and halting the production queue.

This design choice has a beneficial side effect that underscores the interconnectedness of DFAM principles. The pursuit of automation directly leads to a more thermally stable and reliable part. By replacing a large, flat base with a domed one to facilitate ejection, the designer has also eliminated the very geometry that is most prone to warping from thermal stress.

You can also lessen the surface area by creating 45 degree v groves in on the bottom of the parts to lessen the contact area as well.

## Chamfered Bottom Edges

For parts that require a flat base for functional reasons, adding a large chamfer (typically 45 degrees) to the bottom edge is another effective strategy. This chamfer serves two purposes. First, it mitigates the "elephant's foot" effect—a common artifact where the first few layers bulge outwards due to heat and pressure—which can create a sharp, undercut edge that snags on the build plate. Second, the angled surface of the chamfer provides an ideal ramp for a pusher mechanism to engage with. The force from the pusher is translated into both a horizontal and a vertical component, helping to lift the part up and off the build plate rather than just shearing it sideways.
