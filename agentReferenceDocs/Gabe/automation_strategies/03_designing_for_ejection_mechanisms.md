# 3.3. Designing for Ejection Mechanisms

The designer must consider the specific ejection mechanism that will be used. If the print head is the pusher, a robust, non-cosmetic surface on the part should be designed at the appropriate height to serve as a contact point. This prevents the hotend from damaging a functional or aesthetic feature of the part during ejection.

For systems that rely on gravity-assisted ejection, where the entire printer is tilted to allow the part to slide off, the part's center of gravity and surface friction become important design considerations. The geometry must be stable enough during printing but also designed to slide cleanly and predictably into the collection bin once released from the build plate.

The ability to design for reliable, automated part ejection is the capstone of creating a truly autonomous manufacturing system. It is the final link in the chain that enables 24/7, continuous production. A print farm without this capability is still fundamentally limited by the need for human operators to harvest parts, constraining its productivity to operator shifts. With auto-ejection, the farm's operational capacity is maximized, dramatically improving the return on investment and solidifying FDM's position as a competitive technology for mass production.
