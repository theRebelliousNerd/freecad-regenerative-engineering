# Conveyor Belt Systems for Continuous 3D Printing

Conveyor belt systems represent a significant step forward in the automation of FDM 3D printing. By replacing the traditional build plate with a continuously moving belt, these systems enable true 24/7, lights-out manufacturing.

## Leading Systems (2024-2025)
- **Creality CR-30 3DPrintMill**: The most popular and accessible belt printer, with a price range of $424-$849. It has played a key role in popularizing this technology.
- **iFactory One PRO**: An industrial-grade belt printer that is designed for high-volume production. It has a price of â‚¬4,748.
- **PowerBelt3D Formula32**: A versatile belt printer that is compatible with a wide range of materials, including PETG, TPU, PLA, and ABS.

## Benefits of Conveyor Belt Systems
- **Continuous Printing**: The primary advantage of a belt printer is that it can print continuously without the need for manual intervention. As soon as a part is finished, it is automatically transported off the belt and into a collection bin, and the next print begins immediately.
- **Increased Productivity**: By eliminating the need for manual part removal, belt printers can provide a 3x productivity boost for automated print cells.
- **Printing of Long Parts**: Belt printers are capable of printing parts that are much longer than the printer itself, as the length of the part is only limited by the length of the belt.
