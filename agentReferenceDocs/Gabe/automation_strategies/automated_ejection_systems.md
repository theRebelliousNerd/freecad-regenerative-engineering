# Automated Ejection Systems for Print Farms

Automated ejection systems are a critical component of any lights-out 3D printing operation. These systems are responsible for removing completed parts from the build plate, clearing the way for the next print to begin.

## Leading Systems (2024-2025)
- **3DQue Systems**:
  - **QuinlyVision AI**: An AI-powered vision system that can detect a wide range of print failures, including spaghetti, layer shifts, and warping.
  - **AutoFarm3D**: A software platform that enables 24/7 operation of a print farm, with real-time job tracking and remote management capabilities.
- **Universal Robots Integration**:
  - **UR10 Robotic Arms**: These collaborative robots can be used to automate a wide range of tasks in a print farm, including part removal, bed replacement, and quality control.
  - It is estimated that robotic arms can automate up to 10% of the total factory work in a print farm.

## Design for Ejection
For automated ejection to be successful, the parts themselves must be designed for easy removal. This involves a number of strategies, including:

- **Minimizing Bed Contact**: The part should be designed to have minimal contact with the build plate. This can be achieved by orienting the part at a 45-degree angle, or by using a domed or chamfered bottom surface.
- **Designing for Pusher Mechanisms**: The part should be designed with a robust, non-cosmetic surface that can be used as a contact point for a pusher mechanism.
- **Gravity-Assisted Ejection**: For systems that use gravity-assisted ejection, the part's center of gravity and surface friction must be taken into account to ensure that it slides cleanly and predictably into the collection bin.
