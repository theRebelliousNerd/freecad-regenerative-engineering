# Designing for Automated Part Ejection

The apotheosis of a modern print farm is fully autonomous, "lights-out" manufacturing, where printers operate continuously 24/7 without the need for human intervention. The final and most challenging step in this automation chain is the physical removal of the completed part from the build plate, clearing the way for the next print to begin. This capability is not solely dependent on hardware; it is fundamentally enabled by intelligent part design. The part's geometry must be engineered to facilitate its own removal.
