# Material Selection Guide

This guide provides a framework for selecting the right material for your 3D printing application. It includes a decision matrix, a performance requirements matrix, and a quick reference guide.

## Application-Based Selection

| Application | Primary Material | Alternative | Key Requirement |
|------------|-----------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Prototypes | PLA | PETG | Fast, cheap |
| Outdoor Parts | ASA | PETG | UV resistance |
| High-Temp | PC | ABS | Heat resistance |
| Flexible | TPU 95A | TPU 85A | Durometer |
| Chemical Resistant | PP | PETG | Chemical compatibility |
| Food Contact | PETG | PP | FDA approved |
| High Strength | PC-CF | Nylon-CF | Mechanical properties |
| Transparent | PETG Clear | PC | Optical clarity |

## Performance Requirements Matrix

```
Selection Criteria Weighting:
□ Mechanical Strength (0-30%)
□ Temperature Resistance (0-30%)
□ Chemical Resistance (0-20%)
□ Printability (0-20%)
□ Cost (0-30%)
□ Aesthetics (0-20%)
□ Sustainability (0-20%)
Total must equal 100%

## Quick Reference Guide

### Material Selection Priority
1. **Functional requirements** (strength, temperature, flexibility)
2. **Environmental conditions** (indoor/outdoor, chemicals)
3. **Printability** (equipment capabilities)
4. **Cost constraints** (material + processing)
5. **Aesthetic requirements** (color, finish)
6. **Sustainability goals** (recyclable, biodegradable)

### Common Material Mistakes
- ❌ Using PLA for outdoor applications
- ❌ Not drying hygroscopic materials
- ❌ Ignoring material expiration
- ❌ Over-specifying material properties
- ❌ Not considering total lifecycle cost

### Best Practices
- ✅ Test materials before production
- ✅ Maintain material traceability
- ✅ Implement proper storage
- ✅ Document successful parameters
- ✅ Consider sustainable alternatives
