# TPU (Thermoplastic Polyurethane): For Flexible and Compliant Parts

TPU is a flexible and elastic thermoplastic that is similar to rubber. It is a good choice for a wide range of applications that require flexibility, durability, and shock absorption.

## Properties and Applications

**Strengths**:
- **Excellent Flexibility**: TPU is a very flexible material that can be stretched and compressed without breaking.
- **High Abrasion Resistance**: It is a very durable material that is resistant to abrasion.
- **Good Chemical Resistance**: TPU is resistant to a wide range of chemicals, including oils, greases, and solvents.
- **Shock Absorption**: It is a good choice for parts that need to absorb shock and vibration.
- **Wide Durometer Range**: TPU is available in a wide range of durometers, from 60A (very soft) to 95D (very hard).

**Weaknesses**:
- **Slow Print Speeds Required**: TPU must be printed at very slow speeds to prevent the filament from buckling in the extruder.
- **Difficult to Print**: It can be a difficult material to print, and it is prone to stringing and oozing.
- **Poor Bridging Capability**: TPU has poor bridging capability, which means it is not a good choice for parts with large unsupported horizontal spans.
- **Requires Direct Drive Extruder**: A direct drive extruder is recommended for printing TPU, as it provides better control over the filament.

**Optimal Applications**:
- Seals and gaskets
- Vibration dampeners
- Phone cases
- Wheels and tires
- Flexible joints

## Optimization Strategies

**Print Settings**:
- **Nozzle Temperature**: 220-250°C
- **Bed Temperature**: 50-60°C
- **Print Speed**: 15-30 mm/s
- **Cooling Fan**: 0-50%
- **Retraction**: Minimal (1-2 mm)

**Success Tips**:
- **Use a Direct Drive Extruder**: A direct drive extruder is highly recommended for printing TPU.
- **Disable Retraction if Possible**: If you are still having trouble with stringing, you can try disabling retraction altogether.
- **Print Slow and Steady**: The key to success with TPU is to print slow and steady.
- **Increase Flow Rate 5-10%**: Increasing the flow rate by 5-10% can help to improve layer adhesion.
- **Use a Wider Line Width**: Using a wider line width can also help to improve layer adhesion.
