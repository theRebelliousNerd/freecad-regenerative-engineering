# Engineering Plastics: A Guide to High-Performance Materials

This guide covers the properties, applications, and challenges of high-performance engineering plastics, including Polycarbonate (PC) and composite materials.

## Polycarbonate (PC)

**Properties**:
- **Highest Temperature Resistance**: PC has a very high glass transition temperature of 147Â°C, making it an excellent choice for high-temperature applications.
- **Excellent Impact Strength**: It is an extremely tough and durable material that is resistant to impact.
- **Optical Clarity Available**: PC is available in a clear form, which makes it a good choice for parts that need to be transparent.
- **Engineering-Grade Strength**: It is a very strong and stiff material that is suitable for a wide range of engineering applications.

**Challenges and Solutions**:
- **Warping**: PC is very prone to warping. A PC-ABS blend can be used to reduce warping and make the material easier to print.
- **Bed Adhesion**: A PC-specific adhesive is recommended for good bed adhesion.
- **Temperature**: An all-metal hotend is required to print PC, as it requires very high temperatures.
- **Moisture**: PC is highly hygroscopic and must be dried in a filament dryer before use.

## Composite Materials

Composite materials are created by reinforcing a base polymer with fibers, such as carbon fiber or glass fiber. This results in a material with improved strength, stiffness, and dimensional stability.

### Carbon Fiber Reinforced

**Benefits**:
- **Increased Stiffness**: Carbon fiber reinforcement can increase the stiffness of a material by 30-50%.
- **Reduced Warping**: The addition of carbon fiber can help to reduce warping.
- **Matte Surface Finish**: Carbon fiber reinforced materials have a matte surface finish that can help to hide layer lines.
- **Dimensional Stability**: They are very dimensionally stable and are less prone to shrinking and warping than their non-reinforced counterparts.

**Considerations**:
- **Abrasive**: Carbon fiber is very abrasive and will quickly wear out a standard brass nozzle. A hardened steel nozzle is required.
- **More Expensive**: Carbon fiber reinforced materials are typically 2-3 times more expensive than their non-reinforced counterparts.
- **Reduced Layer Adhesion**: The addition of carbon fiber can reduce layer adhesion, which can make parts more brittle.
- **Limited Flexibility**: Carbon fiber reinforced materials are very stiff and have limited flexibility.

### Glass Fiber Reinforced

- **Lower Cost than Carbon Fiber**: Glass fiber is a more affordable alternative to carbon fiber.
- **Good Strength Improvement**: It provides a good improvement in strength and stiffness.
- **Less Abrasive**: Glass fiber is less abrasive than carbon fiber, but a hardened steel nozzle is still recommended.
- **Maintains Some Flexibility**: Glass fiber reinforced materials are more flexible than their carbon fiber reinforced counterparts.
