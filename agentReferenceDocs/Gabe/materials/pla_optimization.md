# PLA (Polylactic Acid): The Standard for Rapid Prototyping and General Use

## Properties and Applications
PLA is the most common and easiest to print material in FDM 3D printing. It is a biodegradable thermoplastic derived from renewable resources such as corn starch or sugar cane.

**Strengths**:
- **High Compressive Strength**: PLA is very rigid and has the highest compressive strength of the standard FDM materials.
- **Minimal Warping and Shrinkage**: It has a low coefficient of thermal expansion, which means it is less prone to warping and shrinking than other materials.
- **Biodegradable**: PLA is compostable under industrial conditions, making it a more environmentally friendly choice than petroleum-based plastics.
- **No Toxic Fumes**: It does not produce any toxic fumes during printing, making it safe to use in an office or home environment.
- **Excellent Dimensional Accuracy**: Due to its low shrinkage, PLA is an excellent choice for parts that require tight tolerances.

**Weaknesses**:
- **Low Heat Resistance**: PLA has a low glass transition temperature of around 60°C, which means it will start to deform at relatively low temperatures.
- **Brittle Failure Mode**: PLA is a very stiff material, but it is also very brittle. It will tend to shatter on impact rather than deform.
- **UV Degradation**: PLA is not suitable for outdoor use, as it will degrade and become even more brittle when exposed to UV radiation.
- **Limited Chemical Resistance**: PLA is not resistant to a wide range of chemicals, and it can be dissolved by solvents such as acetone.

**Optimal Applications**:
- Prototypes and concept models
- Indoor decorative items
- Educational models
- Jigs and fixtures (for low-temperature applications)
- Consumer products that are not subjected to high temperatures or mechanical stress

## Optimization Strategies

**Print Settings**:
- **Nozzle Temperature**: 200-220°C
- **Bed Temperature**: 50-60°C
- **Print Speed**: 40-80 mm/s
- **Cooling Fan**: 100% after the first layer
- **Retraction**: 5-6 mm @ 40 mm/s

**Cost Optimization**:
- **Print Speed**: PLA can be printed at relatively high speeds, which can help to reduce print time and cost.
- **Cooling**: Maximize cooling to allow for faster printing of bridges and overhangs.
- **Infill**: For non-structural parts, the infill can be reduced to 15-20% to save material and print time.
- **Enclosure**: No heated enclosure is required to print PLA.
