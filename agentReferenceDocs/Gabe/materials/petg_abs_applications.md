# PETG, ABS, and ASA: Durable Materials for Functional Parts

This guide covers the properties, applications, and optimization strategies for PETG, ABS, and ASA. These materials are a step up from PLA in terms of durability, temperature resistance, and chemical resistance, making them suitable for a wide range of functional parts.

## PETG (Polyethylene Terephthalate Glycol)

**Properties and Applications**:
**Strengths**:
- **Excellent Layer Adhesion**: PETG has excellent layer adhesion, which makes it a good choice for parts that need to be strong and durable.
- **Good Chemical Resistance**: It is resistant to a wide range of chemicals, including acids, bases, and solvents.
- **Moderate Flexibility**: PETG is more flexible than PLA, which makes it less brittle and more resistant to impact.
- **Weather Resistant**: It is UV resistant and does not absorb water, making it a good choice for outdoor applications.
- **Clear Variants Available**: PETG is available in a clear form, which makes it a good choice for parts that need to be transparent.

**Weaknesses**:
- **Tendency to String**: PETG is prone to stringing, which can be difficult to control.
- **Hygroscopic**: It absorbs moisture from the air, which can lead to poor print quality. It should be dried before use.
- **Can Stick Too Well to Bed**: PETG can adhere very strongly to the build plate, which can make it difficult to remove parts without damaging them.

**Optimal Applications**:
- Mechanical parts
- Outdoor fixtures
- Liquid containers
- Protective covers
- Medical devices

**Optimization Strategies**:
**Print Settings**:
- **Nozzle Temperature**: 230-250°C
- **Bed Temperature**: 70-80°C
- **Print Speed**: 30-60 mm/s
- **Cooling Fan**: 50-70%
- **Retraction**: 3-5 mm @ 30 mm/s

**Efficiency Tips**:
- **Use a Release Agent**: A release agent, such as a glue stick or hairspray, can be used to prevent the part from sticking too well to the build plate.
- **Dry Filament Before Use**: PETG should be dried in a filament dryer at 65°C for 4 hours before use.
- **Optimize Retraction**: The retraction settings should be carefully tuned to prevent stringing.
- **Consider Coasting Settings**: Coasting can be used to reduce stringing by turning off the extruder for a short distance before the end of a perimeter.

## ABS (Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene)

**Properties and Applications**:
**Strengths**:
- **High Temperature Resistance**: ABS has a high glass transition temperature of around 95°C, which makes it a good choice for parts that will be exposed to high temperatures.
- **Good Impact Strength**: It is a tough and durable material that is resistant to impact.
- **Excellent Post-Processing Options**: ABS can be easily sanded, machined, and painted.
- **Acetone Smoothing Capable**: It can be smoothed with acetone vapor to create a smooth, glossy surface finish.

**Weaknesses**:
- **High Warping Tendency**: ABS is prone to warping, which can make it difficult to print large parts.
- **Toxic Fumes**: It produces toxic fumes during printing, which requires a well-ventilated area.
- **UV Degradation**: ABS is not suitable for outdoor use, as it will degrade and become brittle when exposed to UV radiation.
- **Requires Heated Enclosure**: A heated enclosure is required to print ABS successfully.

**Optimal Applications**:
- Automotive parts
- Electronic enclosures
- High-temperature applications
- Functional prototypes
- Production parts (with post-processing)

**Optimization Strategies**:
**Print Settings**:
- **Nozzle Temperature**: 230-260°C
- **Bed Temperature**: 100-110°C
- **Print Speed**: 30-60 mm/s
- **Cooling Fan**: 0-30%
- **Enclosure**: Required

**Warping Prevention**:
- **Use a Brim or Raft**: A brim or raft can be used to improve bed adhesion and prevent warping.
- **Maintain Chamber Temperature**: The temperature of the enclosure should be maintained between 40°C and 60°C.
- **Apply ABS Slurry to Bed**: An ABS slurry can be used to improve bed adhesion.
- **Minimize Bed Contact Area**: The part should be designed to have minimal contact with the build plate.
- **Use Draft Shields**: A draft shield can be used to protect the part from drafts, which can cause warping.

## ASA (Acrylonitrile Styrene Acrylate)

ASA is a similar material to ABS, but it has been modified to be more resistant to UV radiation. This makes it a better choice for outdoor applications.

**Properties and Applications**:
**Strengths**:
- **UV Resistant**: ASA is highly resistant to UV radiation, which makes it an excellent choice for outdoor applications.
- **High Temperature Resistance**: It has a high glass transition temperature of around 100°C.
- **Good Impact Strength**: ASA is a tough and durable material that is resistant to impact.

**Weaknesses**:
- **High Warping Tendency**: Like ABS, ASA is prone to warping.
- **Requires Heated Enclosure**: A heated enclosure is required to print ASA successfully.

**Optimal Applications**:
- Outdoor fixtures
- Automotive parts
- Sporting goods
- Garden equipment
