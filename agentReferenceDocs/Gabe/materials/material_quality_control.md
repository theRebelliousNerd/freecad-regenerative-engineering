# Material Quality Control

Maintaining a high level of quality control for your 3D printing materials is essential for ensuring consistent print results.

## Incoming Material Inspection

### Test Protocol
1. **Diameter Consistency**: Use a pair of calipers to measure the diameter of the filament at several points along the spool. The tolerance should be no more than Â±0.02 mm.
2. **Moisture Content**: Use a moisture meter to measure the moisture content of the filament. The moisture content should be within the manufacturer's specifications.
3. **Color Consistency**: Visually inspect the filament for color consistency. If you are using a colorimeter, you can use it to measure the color of the filament and compare it to a known standard.
4. **Print Test**: Print a standard test piece to evaluate the print quality of the filament.
5. **Mechanical Test**: If the mechanical properties of the material are critical for your application, you can print a tensile bar and test it to failure.
