# Nylon (Polyamide): For High-Strength Functional Parts

Nylon is a high-performance engineering thermoplastic that is known for its excellent strength, durability, and chemical resistance. It is a good choice for a wide range of functional parts, but it can be difficult to print.

## Specifications
- **PA6**: Has a lower melting point and is easier to print than PA12.
- **PA12**: Has better dimensional stability and is less prone to moisture absorption than PA6.
- **PA6-CF**: A carbon fiber reinforced version of PA6 that has increased stiffness and strength.

## Applications
- **Gears and Bearings**: Nylon is a good choice for gears and bearings due to its low coefficient of friction and high wear resistance.
- **Living Hinges**: It is a flexible material that can be used to create living hinges.
- **Structural Components**: Nylon is a strong and durable material that can be used for a wide range of structural components.
- **Chemical-Resistant Parts**: It is resistant to a wide range of chemicals, making it a good choice for parts that will be exposed to harsh environments.

## Processing Requirements

**Critical Factors**:
- **Dry Filament Essential**: Nylon is highly hygroscopic, which means it absorbs moisture from the air. It must be dried in a filament dryer at 80°C for 8-12 hours before use. The moisture content should be less than 0.2%.
- **Heated Chamber Recommended**: A heated chamber is recommended to prevent warping and improve layer adhesion.
- **Garolite or PEI Bed Surface**: A Garolite or PEI bed surface is recommended for good bed adhesion.
- **Nozzle Temperature**: 250-280°C
- **Active Drying During Print**: For long prints, it is recommended to use an active drying system to prevent the filament from absorbing moisture during the printing process.
