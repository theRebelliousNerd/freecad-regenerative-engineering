# Material Storage and Handling

Proper storage and handling of 3D printing materials is essential for maintaining their quality and ensuring consistent print results.

## Moisture Management

Many 3D printing filaments are hygroscopic, which means they absorb moisture from the air. This can lead to a number of problems, including:

- **Poor Print Quality**: Wet filament can cause stringing, oozing, and bubbling, resulting in a poor surface finish.
- **Failed Prints**: In severe cases, wet filament can cause the print to fail altogether.
- **Reduced Mechanical Properties**: The mechanical properties of the material can be degraded by moisture.

### Storage Requirements by Material
| Material | Max Humidity | Storage Temp | Drying Temp | Drying Time |
|----------|--------------|--------------|-------------|-------------|
| PLA | 40% | 15-25°C | 40°C | 4 hours |
| PETG | 30% | 15-25°C | 65°C | 4-6 hours |
| ABS | 40% | 15-25°C | 80°C | 2-4 hours |
| Nylon | 20% | 15-25°C | 80°C | 8-12 hours |
| TPU | 30% | 15-25°C | 60°C | 4-6 hours |
| PC | 10% | 15-25°C | 120°C | 6-8 hours |

### Active Drying Systems
- **Filament Dryers**: These are commercially available devices that are designed to dry filament. They typically cost between $50 and $200 and can handle 1-2 spools at a time.
- **Dry Boxes**: These are sealed containers that are used to store filament in a low-humidity environment. They can be equipped with a desiccant to absorb moisture.
- **Industrial Dryers**: These are larger, more expensive dryers that are designed for use in a production environment.
- **DIY Solutions**: It is also possible to build your own filament dryer using a food dehydrator with a temperature control.

## Inventory Management

### Just-In-Time Strategy
```
Optimization Approach:
1. Maintain a 2-week buffer of material.
2. Track usage patterns by SKU.
3. Implement an automatic reordering system.
4. Rotate stock using the First-In, First-Out (FIFO) principle.
5. Monitor the expiration date of the material.
