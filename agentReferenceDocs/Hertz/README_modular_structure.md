### 2. Modular Decomposition
Each knowledge module is:
- **Self-contained**: Complete coverage of specific domain
- **Interconnected**: Clear dependencies and relationships
- **Contextual**: Optimized for specific engineering scenarios
- **Scalable**: Can be loaded individually or in curated sets

### 3. Selective Loading System
Implements context menus for efficient knowledge activation:
- **Quick start**: Essential modules for basic understanding
- **Focus areas**: Curated module sets for specific disciplines
- **Research mode**: Complete knowledge base access
- **Dynamic loading**: Real-time module selection based on user needs
