# Hertz Agent Audit: To-Do List and Workflow

This document outlines the process for auditing the Hertz agent's knowledge base to ensure that all parsed files are accurate, context-rich, and directly sourced from the `original-docs-archive`.

## Workflow: Audit and Verification

1.  **Select a File for Audit:** I will select one file from the Hertz agent's knowledge base to audit.
2.  **Identify Source Section:** I will identify the corresponding section(s) in the `original-docs-archive` that were used to create the selected file.
3.  **Compare and Verify:** I will compare the content of the selected file with the source section(s) to verify the following:
    *   **Completeness:** The parsed file contains all the relevant information from the source section(s), including any tables, code blocks, or other formatted content.
    *   **Accuracy:** The information in the parsed file is a verbatim copy of the source section(s). There are no summaries, paraphrases, or distillations.
    *   **Enhancement:** The parsed file is properly enhanced with a clear title, introduction, and logical structure. The enhancements should not alter the meaning or intent of the original content.
4.  **Correct if Necessary:** If any discrepancies are found, I will correct the parsed file to ensure it meets the audit criteria. This may involve:
    *   Adding missing content from the source document.
    *   Removing any summarized or paraphrased content and replacing it with the verbatim text from the source.
    *   Restructuring the file to better reflect the logical flow of the source document.
5.  **Identify Unparsed Content:** After auditing all the files in a subdirectory, I will review the corresponding source document(s) to identify any content that has not been parsed into a file. If I find any unparsed content, I will create a new file for it in the appropriate subdirectory.
6.  **Update To-Do List:** Once a file has been audited and corrected, and any unparsed content has been addressed, I will mark it as complete in this to-do list.

## AUDIT SUMMARY
- **Total Target Files**: 35 specialized knowledge modules
- **Current Implementation**: 11 files identified (~31% complete)
- **Critical Gaps**: simulation_methods/ and integration_guides/ completely missing
- **Quality Assessment**: Existing files are high quality and technically accurate
- **Business Impact**: Agent cannot fulfill core FreeCAD RF design mission without completion

## PRIORITY ACTIONS REQUIRED
1. **CRITICAL**: Complete simulation_methods/ subdirectory (FreeCAD integration)
2. **CRITICAL**: Complete integration_guides/ subdirectory (multi-agent coordination)  
3. **HIGH**: Complete emc_compliance/ subdirectory (regulatory compliance)
4. **HIGH**: Complete remaining wireless_protocols/ and rf_circuits/ files
