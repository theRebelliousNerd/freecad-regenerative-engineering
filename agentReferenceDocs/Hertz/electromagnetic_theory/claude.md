# Electromagnetic Theory Knowledge Module
*Follow the Cable: Electromagnetic Fields as Invisible Information Networks*

## Subdirectory Purpose
This module contains the fundamental electromagnetic theory that underlies all RF and wireless system design. These files establish the mathematical foundation and physical understanding of how electromagnetic energy propagates, couples, and manifests as the invisible "cables" that connect every element of an RF system.

## The Electromagnetic Cable Network Perspective
In the Follow the Cable mental model, electromagnetic fields are the ultimate expression of invisible connections:

- **Electric fields** are voltage cables that couple energy between conductors
- **Magnetic fields** are current cables that store and transfer energy in inductors and transformers  
- **Electromagnetic waves** are information cables carrying signals through space and transmission lines
- **Near field coupling** creates parasitic cables that affect component placement and isolation
- **Ground planes** form reference cables that affect all other field distributions

### Primary Electromagnetic Cables:
1. **Field Distribution Cable**: Maxwell equations → current distributions → radiation patterns → coverage zones
2. **Impedance Cable**: Transmission line equations → VSWR → power transfer → thermal dissipation  
3. **Coupling Cable**: Near field equations → mutual inductance/capacitance → crosstalk → isolation requirements
4. **Propagation Cable**: Wave equations → path loss → fade margins → link reliability
5. **Frequency Cable**: Dispersion relations → component values → bandwidth → tuning requirements

### Cross-Domain Cable Handoffs:
- **To Antenna Design**: Field equations provide radiation pattern calculations and impedance theory
- **To RF Circuits**: Transmission line theory provides interconnect models and coupling analysis
- **To EMC Compliance**: Field coupling equations predict interference and shielding effectiveness  
- **To Thermal Analysis**: Power density calculations from Poynting vector analysis
- **To Mechanical Design**: Near field distributions define keep-out zones and component placement

Retrieve additional electromagnetic theory when you encounter:
- Unexplained resonances or impedance variations
- Coupling effects that don't match simple circuit models  
- Radiation patterns that deviate from textbook predictions
- Frequency-dependent behavior that suggests wave effects
- EMC failures that point to fundamental field coupling issues

## Integration with FreeCAD MCP:

These electromagnetic foundations enable:
- Parametric antenna geometry based on field theory
- Transmission line models for interconnect design  
- Near field visualization for component placement
- Ground plane optimization for EMC performance
- Material property assignment for accurate field simulation

Remember: Every conductor is an antenna, every trace is a transmission line, and every gap is a capacitor. The electromagnetic fields connect everything.
