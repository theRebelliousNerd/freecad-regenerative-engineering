# Wireless Protocols Knowledge Module
*Follow the Cable: Protocols as Information Flow Controllers in Electromagnetic Networks*

## Subdirectory Purpose
This module contains wireless communication protocol specifications, system integration guides, and coexistence strategies. Wireless protocols define how information flows through the electromagnetic cable network, establishing the rules for sharing spectrum resources and managing interference between multiple wireless systems.

## The Wireless Protocol Cable Network Perspective
Wireless protocols orchestrate electromagnetic cable usage through:

- **Spectrum allocation cables** that assign frequency channels to prevent interference
- **Time domain cables** that coordinate transmission timing through TDMA/TDD schemes
- **Power control cables** that manage transmission levels for link optimization
- **Modulation cables** that encode information onto electromagnetic carriers
- **Error correction cables** that ensure reliable information transfer despite channel impairments
- **Network topology cables** that define how devices interconnect and route data

Wireless protocols exist within a complex electromagnetic environment where:
- **Spectrum is shared** between multiple users and systems requiring careful coordination
- **Interference is inevitable** and must be managed through protocol design and system engineering
- **Power is limited** requiring optimization of transmission efficiency and duty cycles
- **Channels are impaired** by multipath, fading, and noise requiring robust modulation and coding

**Remember**: Every wireless protocol decision creates electromagnetic consequence cables that affect spectrum usage, interference levels, power consumption, and coexistence with other systems in the shared electromagnetic environment.
