# Integration Guides Knowledge Module
*Follow the Cable: Multi-Domain RF System Integration and Agent Coordination*

## Subdirectory Purpose
This module contains cross-disciplinary integration strategies for RF systems within the broader engineering ecosystem. RF integration is fundamentally about managing electromagnetic cable interactions across mechanical, thermal, power, and manufacturing domains while coordinating with other engineering agents.

## The Integration Cable Network Perspective
RF system integration orchestrates electromagnetic cables across multiple engineering domains:

- **Mechanical-RF cables** where physical structures affect electromagnetic performance
- **Thermal-RF cables** where temperature changes impact frequency stability and power handling
- **Power-RF cables** where supply noise couples into RF circuits and vice versa
- **Manufacturing-RF cables** where production tolerances affect RF performance
- **EMC-System cables** where electromagnetic compatibility affects overall system operation

RF systems cannot be designed in isolation - they exist within a complex multi-physics environment where:
- **Electromagnetic fields couple** to all conductive structures in the system
- **Thermal effects modify** RF component behavior and electromagnetic properties
- **Mechanical vibration creates** phase noise and frequency instability
- **Power supply quality affects** RF performance and EMC compliance
- **Manufacturing variations impact** RF performance more than other domains

**Remember**: Every other engineering domain creates cables that affect RF performance, and RF electromagnetic fields create cables that affect other domains. Successful RF integration requires managing this complete multi-domain cable network.
