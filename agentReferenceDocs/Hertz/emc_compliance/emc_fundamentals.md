# EMC Fundamentals: Electromagnetic Compatibility Engineering

## Executive Summary
Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) ensures that electronic systems operate satisfactorily in their electromagnetic environment without causing unacceptable interference to other systems. This discipline combines Maxwell's equations with regulatory science, requiring deep understanding of coupling mechanisms, measurement techniques, and mitigation strategies.

**EMC Principle**: "Every circuit is simultaneously a source of electromagnetic energy and a receptor for electromagnetic interference. Design for peaceful coexistence in the electromagnetic spectrum."

## Fundamental EMC Concepts

### Definition and Scope
**Electromagnetic Compatibility**: The ability of a device, equipment or system to function satisfactorily in its electromagnetic environment without introducing intolerable electromagnetic disturbances to other systems in that environment.

**Two aspects**:
1. **Emission**: Device must not emit excessive electromagnetic energy
2. **Immunity**: Device must function properly in presence of electromagnetic disturbances

**Three elements**:
- **Source**: Generates electromagnetic energy
- **Coupling path**: Transfers energy from source to victim
- **Victim**: Receives and responds to electromagnetic energy

### EMC vs EMI
**EMC (Electromagnetic Compatibility)**: System-level design philosophy
**EMI (Electromagnetic Interference)**: Specific interference phenomena
**EMS (Electromagnetic Susceptibility)**: Inability to withstand interference

**Relationship**: EMC = Controlled EMI + Adequate EMS margins

### Time Domain vs Frequency Domain
**Time domain**: Actual signal waveforms, transient events
**Frequency domain**: Spectral content, measurement domain
**Fourier relationship**: Time domain signals have frequency domain signatures

**Key insight**: Fast rise time signals contain high frequency energy
