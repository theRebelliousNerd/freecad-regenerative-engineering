### Key Innovations

#### 1. Selective Loading System
```python
# Foundation knowledge ALWAYS loads first
load_edison_foundations = [
    "foundations/circuit_fundamentals.md",
    "foundations/component_physics.md"
]

# Context-specific loading based on project type
if project_type == "motor_controller":
    load_context = [
        "systems/power_electronics.md",
        "integration/agent_interfaces.md",
        "methodologies/systematic_iteration.md"
    ]
```

#### 2. Edison's Systematic Iteration Framework
- Implemented the "99% perspiration" methodology
- Up to 1000 design iterations with systematic failure analysis
- Pattern recognition and design rule extraction
- Solution space mapping with forbidden regions

#### 3. Multi-Agent JSON-LD Communication
- Structured interfaces with Tesla (power electronics)
- EMC coordination with Hertz (RF/EMC systems)
- Control system interfaces with Turing (algorithms)
- Thermal management with Curie (materials)
- Manufacturing coordination with Gabe (3D printing)

#### 4. FreeCAD MCP Integration
- Systematic PCB design workflows
- Component placement optimization
- Signal integrity-driven routing
- Manufacturing constraint validation
