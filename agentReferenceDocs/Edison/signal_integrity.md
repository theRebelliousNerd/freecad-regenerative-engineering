# Signal Integrity Design and Analysis - Edison Agent Reference 2024/2025

## Edison's Approach to Signal Integrity

*"The value of an idea lies in the using of it."* - Thomas Edison

Signal integrity requires the same systematic, empirical approach that Edison applied to invention. Every high-speed trace is a transmission line that must be analyzed, simulated, and validated through methodical testing and iteration.

## Fundamental Signal Integrity Concepts

### Transmission Line Theory
**When Traces Become Transmission Lines:**
- Rule of thumb: Propagation delay > 1/6 of signal rise time
- For 1ns rise time: traces >25mm behave as transmission lines
- For modern digital: virtually all traces are transmission lines
- Critical frequency = 0.35 / rise_time (10%-90%)

**Characteristic Impedance:**
- Z₀ = √(L/C) where L = inductance/length, C = capacitance/length
- Typical values: 50Ω single-ended, 100Ω differential
- Depends on trace geometry, dielectric properties
- Must be controlled throughout signal path

### Signal Degradation Mechanisms

#### Reflections
**Causes:**
- Impedance mismatches at discontinuities
- Unterminated transmission lines
- Via stubs and layer transitions
- Connector interfaces

**Analysis:**
- Reflection coefficient: Γ = (ZL - Z₀)/(ZL + Z₀)
- Perfect match (ZL = Z₀): Γ = 0, no reflection
- Open circuit (ZL = ∞): Γ = 1, full reflection
- Short circuit (ZL = 0): Γ = -1, inverted reflection

#### Crosstalk
**Near-End Crosstalk (NEXT):**
- Capacitive and inductive coupling
- Worst at fast edge rates
- NEXT = -20 log(coupling coefficient)
- Mitigation: increase spacing, add ground traces

**Far-End Crosstalk (FEXT):**
- Accumulates over coupling length
- Proportional to transmission line length
- More problematic for long parallel runs
- FEXT = NEXT × (length/2 × propagation_delay)

## High-Speed Design Rules

### Trace Geometry and Routing

#### Single-Ended Traces
**Microstrip Configuration (surface layer):**
- Z₀ = (87/√(εr+1.41)) × ln(5.98h/(0.8w+t))
- w = trace width, t = trace thickness, h = dielectric height
- εr = dielectric constant of PCB substrate

**Stripline Configuration (internal layer):**
- Z₀ = (60/√εr) × ln(4h/(0.67π(0.8w+t)))
- Better controlled impedance than microstrip
- Natural shielding from reference planes

#### Differential Pairs
**Design Parameters:**
- Single-ended impedance: typically 90-110Ω for 100Ω differential
- Coupling spacing: s = 0.5w to 2w (w = trace width)
- Tight coupling: better noise immunity, more crosstalk
- Loose coupling: less crosstalk, poorer common-mode rejection

**Length Matching Requirements (2024):**
| Interface | Intra-pair Match | Inter-pair Match |
|-----------|------------------|------------------|
| USB 2.0 | ±150 mils | N/A |
| USB 3.0 | ±5 mils | ±25 mils |
| DDR4 | ±10 mils | ±40 mils |
| DDR5 | ±5 mils | ±20 mils |
| PCIe Gen3 | ±5 mils | ±100 mils |
| PCIe Gen4 | ±2 mils | ±50 mils |
| HDMI | ±3 mils | ±50 mils |
| Ethernet | ±25 mils | ±250 mils |

### Via Design for Signal Integrity

#### Via Parasitics
**Equivalent Circuit:**
- Series inductance: L ≈ 5.08h[ln(4h/d)+1] nH
- Shunt capacitance: C ≈ 1.41εrD₁T/(D₁-D₂) pF
- Where h = via length, d = drill diameter, D₁ = pad diameter, D₂ = antipad diameter

**Via Inductance Minimization:**
- Reduce via length (use thinner PCBs)
- Increase drill diameter
- Use multiple vias in parallel
- Minimize layer count for through-hole vias

#### Advanced Via Techniques
**Back-drilling:**
- Remove unused via barrel to eliminate stubs
- Critical for >1GHz signals
- Adds manufacturing cost and complexity
- Typical back-drill accuracy: ±50 μm

**Via-in-Pad:**
- Via directly under component pad
- Eliminates trace stub
- Requires via filling for assembly
- HDI (High Density Interconnect) technology

### Termination Strategies

#### Series Termination
**Implementation:**
- Resistor in series with driver output
- R_series + R_driver = Z₀
- Single termination per net
- Best for point-to-point connections

**Advantages:**
- Low power consumption
- Eliminates reflections from driver
- Simple implementation

#### Parallel Termination
**Resistor to VCC/GND:**
- Pull-up: R = Z₀ × VCC/(VCC - VOH)
- Pull-down: R = Z₀ × VIL/VCC
- Higher power consumption
- Good for multiple receivers

**Thevenin Termination:**
- Resistor divider to VCC and GND
- Lower power than single resistor
- More complex implementation
- Better signal levels

#### AC Coupling
**Series Capacitors:**
- Block DC component, pass AC signals
- Typical values: 0.1-1 μF for high-speed
- Consider capacitor ESL at high frequencies
- Require DC restore circuits

## Power Distribution Network (PDN) Impact

### Power Supply Noise
**Simultaneous Switching Noise (SSN):**
- Multiple outputs switching simultaneously
- Causes ground bounce and supply droop
- Frequency content: 10 MHz - 1 GHz
- Mitigation: decoupling capacitors, current limiting

**Ground Bounce Calculation:**
- ΔV = L × (di/dt)
- L = loop inductance (package + PCB)
- di/dt = current change rate
- Typical: 50-200 mV for modern digital

### Decoupling Network Design

#### Multi-Stage Decoupling
**Capacitor Selection Strategy:**
```
VRM Module: 1000-10000 μF (bulk storage)
Board Level: 100-470 μF (mid-frequency)
Local: 0.1-10 μF (high-frequency)
Package: 1-100 nF (ultra-high-frequency)
```

**Frequency Response:**
- Each capacitor has resonant frequency: fr = 1/(2π√LC)
- Below fr: capacitive (decreasing impedance)
- Above fr: inductive (increasing impedance)
- Overlap resonances for broadband coverage

#### Placement Guidelines
**High-Frequency Decoupling:**
- Within 5mm of power pins
- Short, wide traces or direct via connections
- Multiple small capacitors > single large capacitor
- Consider package parasitics

**Power Plane Design:**
- Solid planes minimize inductance
- Avoid slots and splits
- Bridge splits with capacitors
- Consider current density (1A/mm typical)

**Total Jitter:**

- System budget allocation required

#### Jitter Budgeting
