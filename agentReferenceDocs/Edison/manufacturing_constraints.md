# Manufacturing Constraints and DFM Guidelines - Edison Agent Reference 2024/2025

## Edison's Manufacturing Philosophy

*"Anything that won't sell, I don't want to invent. Its sale is proof of utility, and utility is success."* - Thomas Edison

Design for Manufacturing (DFM) embodies Edison's practical mindset: a brilliant design that cannot be manufactured economically is worthless. Every design decision must consider the realities of production, assembly, and testing.

*"The three great essentials to achieve anything worthwhile are: Hard work, Stick-to-itiveness, and Common sense."* - Thomas Edison

Manufacturing success requires Edison's combination of hard work (thorough analysis), stick-to-itiveness (iterative refinement), and common sense (practical design decisions that work in the real world of production).
