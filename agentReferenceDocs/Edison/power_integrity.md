# Power Integrity Design and Analysis - Edison Agent Reference 2024/2025

## Edison's Power Distribution Philosophy

*"We will make electricity so cheap that only the rich will burn candles."* - Thomas Edison

Power integrity embodies Edison's vision of efficient, reliable power distribution. Every electron's path from source to load must be optimized through systematic analysis and methodical design refinement.

## Power Distribution Network (PDN) Fundamentals

### PDN Impedance Requirements
**Target Impedance Calculation:**
- Z_target = Ripple_voltage / Transient_current
- Typical values: 1-10 mΩ for high-performance digital
- Frequency dependent: must be maintained across bandwidth
- Safety margin: design for 50% of calculated value

**Example Calculation:**
```
Processor: 50A transient, 50mV ripple budget
Z_target = 50mV / 50A = 1mΩ
Design target: 0.5mΩ (50% margin)
```

### Power Delivery Architecture
**Multi-Level Approach:**
1. **Voltage Regulator Module (VRM)**: Primary power conversion
2. **Bulk Capacitors**: Energy storage and low-frequency filtering
3. **Decoupling Capacitors**: High-frequency noise suppression
4. **Package Capacitance**: Ultra-high frequency response
5. **On-die Capacitance**: Instantaneous current supply

## VRM Design Considerations

### Switching Regulator Topology Selection

#### Buck Converter (Step-Down)
**Applications:**
- CPU/GPU power supplies
- Point-of-load regulation
- High-efficiency DC-DC conversion
- Input voltage > output voltage

**Design Parameters:**
- Efficiency: 85-95% typical
- Switching frequency: 100 kHz - 5 MHz
- Output ripple: <1% of output voltage
- Transient response: <50 μs recovery time

#### Multiphase Buck Design
**Advantages:**
- Reduced input/output ripple
- Higher current capability
- Improved thermal distribution
- Better transient response

**Phase Count Selection:**
```
Current per Phase = Total_Current / Phase_Count
Typical: 10-30A per phase maximum
Thermal: Consider copper heating
Cost: Diminishing returns beyond 8 phases
```

### VRM Component Selection

#### Power MOSFETs
**High-Side (Control Switch):**
- Low Rds(on) for efficiency
- Fast switching for high frequency
- Low gate charge for driver efficiency
- Adequate voltage rating (2x input minimum)

**Low-Side (Synchronous Rectifier):**
- Ultra-low Rds(on) prioritized
- Body diode recovery characteristics
- Thermal resistance considerations
- Parallel operation capability

#### Inductor Selection
**Core Material:**
- Ferrite: High frequency, low core loss
- Iron powder: Lower frequency, distributed gap
- Composite: Combines ferrite and iron benefits

**Design Calculations:**
```
L = (Vin - Vout) × Vout / (Vin × ΔI × fsw)
Where: ΔI = inductor ripple current (20-40% of DC current)
       fsw = switching frequency
```

**Critical Parameters:**
- Saturation current: >150% of maximum DC current
- Temperature rise: <40°C at full load
- DC resistance: minimize for efficiency
- Size constraints vs. performance trade-off

#### Output Capacitor Selection
**Capacitor Technologies:**
- **Ceramic**: Low ESR/ESL, high frequency response
- **Tantalum**: Medium ESR, good mid-frequency
- **Aluminum Electrolytic**: High capacitance, bulk storage
- **Polymer**: Low ESR, good transient response

**ESR Impact on Ripple:**
```
Vripple = I_ripple × ESR + (ΔI × L) / (8 × C)
First term: ESR contribution
Second term: Capacitive contribution
```

## Board-Level Power Distribution

### Power Plane Design

#### Plane Impedance Characteristics
**Parallel Plate Resonance:**
- f₀ = c / (2 × √εᵣ × L)
- Where L = longest dimension of plane pair
- Creates high impedance at resonant frequency
- Mitigation: plane capacitance, decoupling strategy

**Current Density Limits:**
- Internal layers: 1-2 A/mm width typical
- External layers: 2-4 A/mm width typical
- Temperature rise: 10°C maximum recommended
- Via current capacity: 1A per 0.2mm diameter

#### Plane Partitioning Strategy
**Solid Planes Preferred:**

- Optimal return path continuity

**Plane Splits (When Necessary):**
- Bridge with capacitors
- Minimize gap width
- Avoid signal crossings
- Consider return current flow

### Decoupling Capacitor Strategy

#### Multi-Level Decoupling Network
**Capacitor Value Selection:**
```
Bulk Storage: 100-10,000 μF (VRM output)
Mid-Frequency: 1-100 μF (board level)
High-Frequency: 0.01-1 μF (local IC)
Ultra-High-Freq: 1-100 nF (package level)
```

#### Placement Guidelines
**High-Frequency Decoupling:**
- Within 5mm of power pins
- Multiple small capacitors > single large
- Minimize trace/via inductance
- Direct power/ground connection preferred

**Loop Inductance Minimization:**
```
L_loop ≈ μ₀ × h × ln(l/w) / 2
Where: h = dielectric thickness
       l = trace length
       w = trace width
Minimize h and l, maximize w
```

#### Frequency Response Optimization
**Capacitor Self-Resonance:**
- f_res = 1 / (2π × √(L × C))
- Below f_res: capacitive behavior
- Above f_res: inductive behavior
- Parallel combination extends useful bandwidth

**Anti-Resonance Mitigation:**
- Stagger capacitor values by 3-10x ratio
- Use different dielectric types
- Include resistance damping
- Optimize placement spacing

### Via Design for Power Distribution

#### Via Inductance Impact
**Single Via Inductance:**
```
L_via ≈ 5.08 × h × [ln(4h/d) + 1] nH
Where: h = via length (mm)
       d = via diameter (mm)
```

**Parallel Via Reduction:**
- N parallel vias: L_total = L_single / N (ideal)
- Practical: coupling effects reduce benefit
- Spacing: >3 × via diameter for independence
- Array configuration: square grid optimal

#### Thermal Via Design
**Heat Dissipation:**
- Thermal resistance: 70°C/W per 0.2mm via
- Via fill: conductive epoxy or copper
- Array density: 1-2mm spacing typical
- Connection to copper pours essential
