## When to Read These Files (Just-in-Time Context)

### **Trigger Level 1: Project Initiation**
Read `01_edison_iterative_methodology.md` when:
- Starting any new electronics project
- Uncertainty about systematic approach to circuit development
- Need to establish iteration framework for complex designs

### **Trigger Level 2: Circuit Analysis Uncertainty**
Read `02_systematic_experimentation_principles.md` when:
- Circuit behavior doesn't match expectations

- Multiple design variables require optimization

### **Trigger Level 3: Validation Failures**
Read `03_empirical_design_validation.md` when:
- Simulation results don't correlate with measurements
- Need to establish test procedures for complex circuits
- Validation protocols need systematic framework

### **Trigger Level 4: Design Failures**
Read `04_failure_analysis_protocols.md` when:
- Circuits fail in unexpected ways
- Root cause analysis needed for reliability issues
- Pattern recognition needed across failure modes

### **Trigger Level 5: Knowledge Building**
Read `05_continuous_improvement_cycles.md` when:
- Need to capture design knowledge for reuse
- Building design rule database
- Systematic knowledge management required

### **The Iteration Cable**
Every design iteration creates knowledge dependencies:
- **Hypothesis Cable**: Links design assumptions to measurable outcomes
- **Data Cable**: Connects measurement results to design modifications
- **Knowledge Cable**: Builds design rules from validated experience

### **The Systematic Cable**
Edison's methodology creates systematic dependencies:
- **Process Cable**: Links problem definition → architecture → prototyping → validation
- **Measurement Cable**: Connects theoretical predictions to empirical results
- **Documentation Cable**: Links current learning to future design capability

### **The Failure Cable** 
Failures create learning dependencies:
- **Root Cause Cable**: Links failure symptoms to fundamental causes
- **Prevention Cable**: Connects failure analysis to design rule updates
- **Prediction Cable**: Links failure patterns to design risk assessment

### **Simple Circuits (Resistive networks, basic filters)**
- Minimal retrieval needed - basic component knowledge sufficient
- Focus on fundamental electrical laws and basic iteration

### **Moderate Circuits (Op-amp circuits, switching circuits)**
- Retrieve specific component datasheets and design rules
- Apply systematic measurement protocols
- Use failure analysis for optimization

### **Complex Circuits (High-speed digital, mixed-signal, RF)**
- Full methodology engagement required
- Systematic experimentation essential
- Comprehensive failure analysis and knowledge capture

### **To Thermal Domain (Watt Agent)**
- Power dissipation calculations from circuit analysis
- Component thermal limits define electrical limits
- Cooling requirements affect component placement

### **To Mechanical Domain (DaVinci/Brunel Agents)**  
- Component dimensions affect enclosure design
- Vibration requirements affect component selection
- Assembly constraints affect circuit topology

### **To Manufacturing Domain (Gabe Agent)**
- PCB process limits affect trace geometries
- Component availability affects circuit architecture
- Assembly requirements affect component selection

**When to recognize electronics design uncertainty:**
- Component behavior deviates from datasheet specifications
- Circuit interactions create unexpected performance
- Manufacturing yield drops below acceptable levels
- Field reliability differs from laboratory validation

**Response Protocol:**
1. Identify which cable system is broken (thermal, signal integrity, power integrity)
2. Retrieve appropriate foundational methodology
3. Apply systematic experimentation to resolve uncertainty
4. Update design knowledge base with validated results

---

The foundations establish that electronics design is not about isolated circuits, but about managing complex cable networks where every component choice creates cascading dependencies across electrical, thermal, mechanical, and manufacturing domains. Edison's systematic iteration methodology provides the framework for navigating these cable networks with disciplined experimentation and knowledge building.
