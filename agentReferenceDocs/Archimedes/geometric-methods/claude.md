# Geometric Methods - Context Menu

## Where Mathematical Cables Become Geometric Reality

This directory contains the geometric implementation of Archimedean principles for creating mathematically sound geometry in FreeCAD. Here, abstract mathematical cables from axioms manifest as concrete geometric relationships. Every sketch constraint, every dimension, every feature is a cable carrying mathematical truth into physical form.

## Directory Contents

### 1. deductive-construction.md
**When to read**: ALWAYS before creating any parametric geometry
**Contains**:
- Two-phase approach: symbolic mathematics first, then geometry
- Relational feature definition (never absolute positioning)
- Feature dependency trees and constraint-driven sketching
- Mathematical proofs as code with self-documenting models
**Triggers**: Creating parametric models, complex geometric relationships, need for robust geometry that updates correctly

### 2. lever-principle-geometry.md
**When to read**: When analyzing structural properties or complex shape properties
**Contains**:
- Finding centroids using Archimedes' mechanical approach
- Quadrature methods for area calculations
- Center of mass calculations for multi-component structures  
- Integration with FreeCAD for automatic property calculation
**Triggers**: Centroid calculations, structural analysis, complex shape property analysis, balancing requirements

**STANDARD WORKFLOW**:
1. deductive-construction.md → Establish mathematical framework
2. lever-principle-geometry.md → Apply for specific geometric properties

**TASK-SPECIFIC**:
- Parametric modeling → deductive-construction.md (MANDATORY)
- Structural properties → lever-principle-geometry.md
- Complex assemblies → Both files in sequence

### Cable Transformation Station
This directory is where cables undergo critical transformation:
1. **Axiom Cables** → **Parametric Dimensions** (symbolic to numeric)
2. **Constraint Cables** → **Sketch Constraints** (mathematical to geometric)
3. **Relationship Cables** → **Feature Dependencies** (abstract to concrete)
4. **Tolerance Cables** → **Dimensional Tolerances** (bounds to geometry)

### Cable Network Map
**INPUT CABLES FROM**: 
- axiomatic-foundations (mathematical truth cables)
- mathematical-verification (certified relationship cables)

**OUTPUT CABLES TO**:
- FreeCAD geometry (manifested cable network)
- constraint-systems (geometric constraint cables)
- All downstream features (dependency cables)

### JITC Loading Triggers
- **Parametric Uncertainty**: How to structure? → Load deductive-construction.md
- **Property Unknown**: Need centroid/moment? → Load lever-principle-geometry.md
- **Cable Break on Update**: Geometry fails when changing → Trace cables in deductive-construction.md
- **Orphan Geometry**: Feature without axiom cable → Full directory reload

## Cable Construction Principles

### From deductive-construction.md (Cable Architecture):
- **Cable Before Geometry**: Establish mathematical cables before any sketch
- **No Orphan Features**: Every geometric element must have an axiom cable
- **Cable References Only**: Features reference cable nodes, never absolute positions
- **Cable Proof Chain**: Geometry construction = cable path documentation

### From lever-principle-geometry.md (Cable Properties):
- **Balance Cables**: Centroid calculations verify cable equilibrium
- **Decomposition Cables**: Complex shapes = network of simple cable segments
- **Verification Cables**: Physical principles validate cable integrity

### Cable Health Indicators
```
HEALTHY CABLE GEOMETRY:
- Updates without breaking when axioms change
- All dimensions trace to spreadsheet/axioms
- No magic numbers (orphan nodes)
- Constraints fully defined (no weak cables)

BROKEN CABLE GEOMETRY:
- "Fix" required after parameter changes
- Hard-coded dimensions (severed cables)
- Over/under-constrained (cable conflicts)
- Features that "float" (no anchor cables)
```

After applying these methods you should have:

1. **Fully Parametric Models**: All dimensions driven by axioms and relationships
2. **Robust Geometry**: Models that update correctly when parameters change
3. **Traceable Features**: Every feature traces back to mathematical basis
4. **Verified Properties**: Centroids, areas, volumes calculated with confidence
5. **Self-Documenting Code**: Geometric construction reads like mathematical proof

### Immediate Cable Inspection Required:
- **Update Failure**: Cable severed between axiom and geometry
- **Magic Numbers**: Orphan nodes without axiom cables
- **Constraint Conflicts**: Cables pulling in opposing directions
- **Property Unknown**: Missing cable for geometric analysis
- **Rebuild Loops**: Circular cable dependencies

### Metacognitive Cable Alerts:
- **Sketch Uncertainty**: Which constraints? → Check cable requirements
- **Feature Confusion**: How to relate? → Trace upstream cables
- **Update Anxiety**: Will it break? → Verify cable continuity first
- **Complexity Overload**: Too many cables → Decompose into sub-networks

## The Geometric Cable Manifesto

Geometry without cables is merely shapes in space - pretty but meaningless. Geometry WITH cables is a living network of mathematical relationships that:

1. **Self-Heals**: Change an axiom, cables propagate updates automatically
2. **Self-Documents**: Cable paths ARE the documentation
3. **Self-Verifies**: Broken cables immediately visible as failures
4. **Self-Organizes**: Cable hierarchy emerges from dependencies

### The PDU Lesson Applied to Geometry

The PDU disaster wasn't just about wrong dimensions - it was about SEVERED CABLES:
- Axiom cable: "about 80mm" (broken at origin)
- Sketch cable: Based on broken axiom (error propagated)
- Feature cables: All downstream geometry wrong (cascade failure)

Proper cable architecture would have made this impossible. The geometry would have refused to generate with a broken axiom cable.

**Remember**: In FreeCAD, the model tree IS the cable diagram. Every parent-child relationship is a cable. Respect the cables, and they will carry your design to mathematical certainty.
