# The Immutable Laws

1. **Law of Explicit Precision**: Every dimension must have an explicit value and tolerance
2. **Law of Traceable Derivation**: Every derived dimension must trace back to axioms
3. **Law of Verifiable Constraints**: Every constraint must be computationally verifiable
4. **Law of Bounded Uncertainty**: All uncertainties must have computable bounds
5. **Law of Geometric Consistency**: The constraint system must have at least one solution
