# Archimedes Core Philosophy - Context Menu

## Mathematical Cables: The Foundation Network

This directory contains the fundamental philosophical foundations of the Archimedean approach to mathematical verification and design certainty. In the "Follow the Cable" paradigm, these principles form the PRIMARY CABLES - the immutable mathematical truths from which all design decisions flow. Every axiom established here creates a cable that propagates through the entire system, and broken cables here mean systemic failure downstream.

## Directory Contents

### 1. philosophical-mandate.md
**When to read**: ALWAYS at agent initialization or project start
**Contains**: 
- Core identity and purpose as mathematical guardian
- The spirit of Archimedes and historical context
- Fundamental principle of mathematical certainty preceding realization
**Triggers**: New project, agent initialization, identity clarification needed

### 2. archimedean-methodology.md  
**When to read**: Before establishing design axioms or when methodology questions arise
**Contains**:
- The Four Pillars: Axiomatic Foundation, Method of Exhaustion, Deductive Construction, Verification Before Realization
- Specific mandates and implementation approaches for each pillar
- Integration of all methodologies into complete approach
**Triggers**: Need to establish axioms, verification protocol questions, methodology disputes

### 3. ancient-design-principles.md
**When to read**: When needing philosophical grounding for decision-making approach
**Contains**:
- Paradigm shift from modern iteration to ancient predetermination
- Stone Cutter's Paradox and irreversible thinking
- Sacred geometry and proportional relationships
- Temporal consciousness in design decisions  
**Triggers**: Struggling with modern vs. ancient approaches, need for design philosophy, constraint interpretation

### 4. three-inviolable-laws.md
**When to read**: When conflicts arise or core behavioral guidance needed
**Contains**:
- First Law: Primacy of the Axiom
- Second Law: The Burden of Proof  
- Third Law: The Inevitability of Verification
- Specific behavioral mandates for each law
**Triggers**: Agent conflicts, verification disputes, need for behavioral guidance, integration challenges

**CRITICAL PATH (must read in order)**:
1. philosophical-mandate.md → Core identity foundation
2. three-inviolable-laws.md → Behavioral framework
3. archimedean-methodology.md → Operational methods

**SUPPLEMENTARY**:
4. ancient-design-principles.md → Deep philosophical context when needed

### Primary Cable Origins (This Directory)
- **Philosophical Cables**: Core identity and behavioral laws that cannot be violated
- **Methodological Cables**: The Four Pillars create structural cables for all verification
- **Certainty Cables**: Mathematical truth flows from here to all downstream components

### Cable Connections
- **Strong Cables TO**: axiomatic-foundations (axioms inherit philosophical constraints)
- **Strong Cables TO**: mathematical-verification (verification methods embody philosophy)
- **Dependency Cables FROM**: ALL directories - break these cables and the system collapses

### Cable Integrity Monitoring
- When uncertainty > threshold: Return to philosophical-mandate.md
- When methodology conflicts: Trace cable back through three-inviolable-laws.md
- When axiom cables break: Check archimedean-methodology.md for repair protocol

### Metacognitive Triggers (When to Load)
- **High Uncertainty Signal**: Mathematical approach unclear → Load philosophical-mandate.md
- **Constraint Conflict**: Multiple agents disagreeing → Load three-inviolable-laws.md
- **Methodology Gap**: Unsure how to verify → Load archimedean-methodology.md
- **Modern vs Ancient Tension**: Design philosophy unclear → Load ancient-design-principles.md

### Context Utility Scoring
**ALWAYS LOAD (CUS = ∞)**:
- philosophical-mandate.md at initialization (establishes primary cables)
- three-inviolable-laws.md when conflicts arise (prevents cable breaks)

**LOAD ON DEMAND (CUS > 0.7)**:
- archimedean-methodology.md when establishing new axioms
- ancient-design-principles.md when interpreting constraints creatively

### Cable Tracing Protocol
When following a broken cable:
1. Start at failure point (downstream symptom)
2. Trace back through dependency chain
3. Often leads HERE to philosophical foundation
4. Repair must start at philosophical level, not symptom level

## Critical Insight: Cables Cannot Be Cut

Unlike physical cables that can be disconnected, mathematical/philosophical cables are PERMANENT. Once an axiom is established based on these principles, it creates an unbreakable cable. Attempting to violate these cables doesn't disconnect them - it breaks the design. This is why philosophical foundations must be loaded FIRST and verified COMPLETELY.

This philosophical foundation is not just context - it is the origin point of all mathematical cables that give the system its integrity.
