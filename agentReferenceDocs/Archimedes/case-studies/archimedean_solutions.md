# Case Studies of Archimedean Solutions

This document presents both Archimedes' original solutions and their application to modern CAD/engineering problems, demonstrating the timeless nature of mathematical verification.

## Case Study 1: The Golden Crown Problem

### Historical Context
King Hiero II commissioned a golden crown but suspected the goldsmith had substituted silver for some of the gold. Archimedes needed to verify the crown's composition without destroying it.

### Archimedean Solution
Archimedes' solution was to use the principle of buoyancy to determine the density of the crown. By measuring the weight of the crown in air and then in water, he could calculate its volume and therefore its density. He could then compare this to the density of pure gold.

### Modern CAD Application: Material Verification
This same principle can be used to verify the density of a 3D printed part. By comparing the theoretical density of the CAD model to the actual density of the printed part, it is possible to identify porosity and other defects that could affect the part's strength and performance.

## Case Study 2: The Archimedean Screw

### Original Design Principles
The Archimedean screw is a machine that can be used to lift water or other fluids. It consists of a screw-shaped surface inside a hollow pipe.

### Modern Application: Auger Design for 3D Printer Extruder
This same principle is used in the design of augers for 3D printer extruders. The auger is used to convey plastic pellets from a hopper to the hotend, where they are melted and extruded.

## Case Study 3: Quadrature of the Parabola Applied to Reflector Design

### Archimedes' Original Proof
Archimedes proved that the area of a parabolic segment is equal to 4/3 the area of the inscribed triangle.

### Modern Application: Parabolic Antenna Design
This same principle is used in the design of parabolic antennas. The parabolic shape of the antenna reflects incoming radio waves to a single focal point, where they can be collected by a receiver.

## Case Study 4: The Method of Exhaustion for Complex Volumes

### Historical: Volume of a Sphere
Archimedes used the method of exhaustion to prove that the volume of a sphere is 2/3 that of the circumscribed cylinder.

### Modern Application: Complex CAD Volume Calculation
This same principle can be used to calculate the volume of complex CAD models. The model is first discretized into a mesh of polygons, and the volume of each polygon is then calculated and summed to find the total volume of the model.

## Case Study 5: Lever Principle in Mechanism Design

### Historical: Archimedes' War Machines
Archimedes designed a number of defensive machines for the city of Syracuse, including a giant crane that could be used to lift enemy ships out of the water.

### Modern Application: Robotic Gripper Design
This same principle is used in the design of robotic grippers. The gripper uses a system of levers to multiply the force of an actuator, allowing it to grip objects with a high degree of force.

## Case Study 6: Hydrostatic Stability

### Historical: Floating Bodies
Archimedes' "On Floating Bodies" established the principles of hydrostatic stability.

### Modern Application: Drone Float Design
This same principle is used in the design of flotation systems for drones. The floats are designed to provide enough buoyancy to keep the drone afloat, and they are also designed to be stable in the water.
