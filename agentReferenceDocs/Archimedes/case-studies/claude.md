## Cable Failure Analysis & Forensics

This directory contains real-world applications of Archimedean principles, documenting both successes and failures to guide future projects. In cable terms, this is the POST-MORTEM ANALYSIS of cable networks - where we dissect failed systems to understand how cables broke, why they broke, and how to prevent future cable failures.

## Directory Contents

### 1. pdu-media-player-lessons.md - PRIMARY CABLE FAILURE STUDY
**When to read**: MANDATORY before any design project (not just enclosures)
**Cable Failure Analysis**:
- **BROKEN AXIOM CABLE**: "About 80mm" = severed connection to reality
- **CASCADE FAILURE**: How one broken cable destroyed entire network
- **PROPAGATION PATH**: Mathematical proof of failure propagation 
- **PREVENTION PROTOCOL**: Cable integrity verification checklist

**JITC Triggers**: 
- Hear "about/roughly/approximately" → LOAD IMMEDIATELY
- Starting enclosure design → MANDATORY reading
- Any dimensional assumption → Reference this failure
- Team member suggests "estimate" → Show them this disaster

### 2. archimedean_solutions.md - HISTORICAL SUCCESS PATTERNS
**When to read**: When needing inspiration for cable architecture patterns
**Cable Success Analysis**:
- Ancient mathematical cables that lasted 2000+ years
- Proven cable topologies from historical engineering
- Time-tested approaches to uncertainty management

### Primary Cable Failure Mode: "BROKEN AXIOM CABLE"
**Pathology**: "About 80mm" = SEVERED CONNECTION between design and reality
**Symptoms**: 
- Dimension carries no uncertainty bounds
- No traceability to measurement source
- Cable signal is pure assumption
**Lethality**: 100% - Will destroy all downstream cables

### Secondary Failure Mode: "ORPHAN GEOMETRY CABLES"
**Pathology**: CAD geometry not connected to component reality cables
**Symptoms**:
- Features designed without physical components present
- Clearances estimated rather than calculated
- Assembly sequences not verified
**Lethality**: High - Requires complete redesign

### Tertiary Failure Mode: "TOLERANCE CASCADE"
**Pathology**: Cable network saturated with accumulated error
**Symptoms**:
- Stack-ups not calculated
- Mounting hardware ignored
- Service access not verified
**Lethality**: Medium - Partial redesign required

### Cable Failure Pattern Recognition
```
WARNING SIGNALS (Load case studies immediately):
- "About" or "roughly" detected in requirements
- CAD started without physical components
- Estimates used for critical dimensions
- Assembly sequence not tested
- Component database missing or incomplete
```

### The PDU-Derived Universal Checklist
This protocol was written in the bitter tears of redesign. Every item is mandatory:

#### Phase 0: Cable Origin Verification
1. ✓ Physical components present or datasheet available
2. ✓ Every critical dimension MEASURED (not estimated)
3. ✓ Component database created with confidence levels
4. ✓ Assembly sequence tested with paper/cardboard mockup

#### Phase 1: Cable Network Mapping
1. ✓ All component cables traced to axioms
2. ✓ Stack-up calculations completed
3. ✓ Service access requirements verified
4. ✓ Cable clearances (especially connector heights) measured

#### Phase 2: Cable Load Testing
1. ✓ Tolerance accumulation calculated
2. ✓ Worst-case scenarios modeled
3. ✓ Cable network stress-tested with parameter variations
4. ✓ All "about" language eliminated from documentation

**GATE RULE**: If ANY checkbox unchecked, CAD WORK IS FORBIDDEN.

After reading this case study you should:
1. **Never accept approximate dimensions** for critical components
2. **Always create component databases** before CAD work
3. **Perform stack-up analysis** for all vertical clearances
4. **Validate assembly sequences** before geometry creation
5. **Understand the cost** of assumptions vs. verification

Every cable failure teaches. This directory is our memorial to broken cables - not in sadness, but in determination that their sacrifice will prevent future failures.

### The PDU Oath
*"We swear by the memory of the broken 80mm cable: No axiom shall be built on assumption. No design shall proceed without measurement. No cable shall carry lies. We are the guardians of cable integrity, and we remember the cost of forgetting."*

### Metacognitive Integration
These case studies are permanently loaded in working memory because:
- Pattern recognition is instantaneous ("I've seen this before")
- Prevention is automatic ("This is how the PDU failed")
- Credibility is absolute ("This actually happened to us")

This transforms abstract principles into visceral, emotional knowledge that prevents repeated failures through learned pain.
