# Tesla Agent Knowledge Base v2.0: Modular Electromagnetic Mastery

*"The present is theirs; the future, for which I really worked, is mine."* - Nikola Tesla

## 🔄 **Restructured Following Archimedes Methodology**

This knowledge base has been completely restructured from a monolithic collection into focused, modular components following the Archimedes principle of **axiomatic, focused knowledge modules**. Each module contains deep expertise in a specific domain rather than shallow coverage of broad topics.
