## Motor Sizing and Selection Methodology

### Phase 1: Requirements Analysis (The Tesla Vision)
Before touching any specification sheets, visualize the complete electromagnetic system:

1. **Load Torque Analysis**:
   ```
   T_total = T_friction + T_acceleration + T_gravity + T_process
   ```
   - Apply 20-30% safety margin for unknown factors
   - Consider worst-case loading conditions

2. **Speed Profile Requirements**:
   ```
   ω_max = (2π × RPM_max) / 60
   α_max = (ω_max - ω_min) / t_accel
   ```
   - Account for acceleration/deceleration phases
   - Consider continuous vs intermittent operation

3. **Duty Cycle Assessment**:
   ```
   P_RMS = √[(P₁²t₁ + P₂²t₂ + ... + Pₙ²tₙ) / T_total]
   ```
   - Calculate RMS power for thermal sizing
   - Consider cooling methods and ambient temperature

### Phase 2: Technology Selection Matrix

| Application Type | Primary Choice | Alternative | Avoid |
|------------------|----------------|-------------|--------|
| **Precision Positioning** | Servo Motor + Encoder | Stepper (low speed) | Induction |
| **High-Speed Spinning** | BLDC | Induction (large sizes) | Stepper |
| **Constant Load Pumping** | Induction | BLDC (efficiency critical) | Stepper |
| **Intermittent Positioning** | Stepper | Servo (complex profiles) | Induction |
| **Battery-Powered** | BLDC | Stepper (positioning) | Induction |

### Phase 3: Electromagnetic Matching

#### **Torque-Speed Characteristic Matching**
Every motor has a unique torque-speed personality:

- **BLDC**: Flat torque curve, speed limited by back-EMF
  ```
  T = K_t × I     (constant torque region)
  ω_max = (V - I×R) / K_e    (speed limit)
  ```

- **Stepper**: High torque at low speed, exponential dropoff
  ```
  T(ω) = T_holding × exp(-ω/ω_corner)
  ```

- **Servo**: Optimized for specific operating region
  ```
  T_continuous < T_motor_rated × Derating_factors
  ```

#### **Inertia Matching for Dynamic Applications**
Tesla's principle: "Match the inertias, control the dynamics"

```
J_reflected = J_load / n²    (where n = gear ratio)
Ratio_optimal = J_motor : J_reflected = 1:1 to 1:10
```

For optimal response:
- J_motor = J_reflected → Maximum power transfer
- J_motor < J_reflected → Better efficiency, slower response
- J_motor > J_reflected → Faster response, lower efficiency
