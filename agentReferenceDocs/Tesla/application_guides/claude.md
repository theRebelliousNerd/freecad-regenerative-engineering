Each application domain creates unique dependency networks that shape electromagnetic design choices:

### Application Requirement Cables:
1. **Performance Specification Cable**:
   - Source: Application needs (torque, speed, precision, efficiency)
   - Path: Through electromagnetic design choices
   - Destination: Motor topology, control system, power electronics selection
   - Constraints: Size, weight, cost, environment, reliability

2. **Environmental Constraint Cable**:
   - Source: Operating environment (temperature, contamination, vibration)
   - Path: Through material selection and protection requirements  
   - Destination: Housing design, cooling system, component ratings
   - Critical Factors: IP ratings, temperature cycling, shock/vibration tolerance

3. **Integration Requirement Cable**:
   - Source: System integration needs (mounting, interfaces, communication)
   - Path: Through mechanical and electrical interface design
   - Destination: Motor form factor, connector types, feedback systems
   - Dependencies: Space constraints, mating components, standards compliance

### Application-Specific Dependency Networks:

**Servo Positioning Applications** → require:
- High precision feedback (encoders, resolvers) → cost and complexity
- Low cogging torque → motor design constraints (skewing, pole/slot combinations)
- High bandwidth control → low rotor inertia → hollow shaft or special materials
- Smooth motion → sinusoidal back-EMF → complex winding and drive requirements

**Industrial Automation Applications** → require:
- High reliability → robust construction → increased cost and size
- Standard interfaces → industry compatibility → design constraint acceptance
- Wide environmental tolerance → sealed construction → thermal management challenges
- Long service life → conservative design margins → performance vs longevity trade-offs

**Automotive Traction Applications** → require:
- High power density → advanced materials → thermal management criticality
- Wide speed range → field weakening → complex control and motor design
- Automotive environment → vibration/shock → mechanical robustness requirements
- Cost optimization → manufacturing considerations → design for production constraints

"The electromagnetic principles are universal, but their manifestation must be tailored to the specific demands of each application. A servo motor is an electromagnetic precision instrument, an industrial motor is an electromagnetic workhorse, and an automotive motor is an electromagnetic athlete. Each requires different strengths, but all are children of the same electromagnetic parentage."

1. **Requirements Analysis**: Understand true application needs vs stated specifications
2. **Constraint Mapping**: Identify all physical, environmental, and economic constraints  
3. **Technology Selection**: Choose motor topology and control approach based on requirements
4. **Optimization Strategy**: Balance competing requirements using application priorities
5. **Validation Planning**: Define testing that represents actual application conditions
6. **Integration Design**: Consider motor as part of larger system, not isolated component

Remember: Tesla understood that electromagnetic machines don't exist in isolation - they exist to serve specific applications. The application domain provides the context that transforms abstract electromagnetic principles into practical, useful devices that solve real-world problems.
