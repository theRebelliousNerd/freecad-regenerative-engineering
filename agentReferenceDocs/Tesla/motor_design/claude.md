# Motor Design - Tesla's Engineering Implementation

## Overview
This directory contains practical motor design methodologies that translate electromagnetic theory into physical machines. These files bridge the gap between Maxwell's equations and manufacturable motors.

## When to Read These Files (Just-in-Time Context)

### Project Initiation Phase:
- **topology_selection.md** - Read FIRST when selecting motor type (BLDC, induction, synchronous)
- **electromagnetic_optimization.md** - Read when refining design for specific performance targets

### Triggered by Design Uncertainties:
- When choosing between inrunner vs outrunner topology
- When torque density requirements seem challenging  
- When efficiency targets demand optimization
- When mechanical constraints conflict with electromagnetic needs

Motor design creates cascading dependency networks that affect the entire electromechanical system:

### Critical Design Cables:
1. **Topology Selection Cable**: 
   - Source: Application requirements (torque, speed, size)
   - Propagates to: Winding method, magnet placement, cooling strategy
   - Affects: Manufacturing complexity, cost, performance envelope

2. **Air Gap Optimization Cable**:
   - Source: Magnetic circuit reluctance and manufacturing tolerances
   - Propagates to: Flux density, cogging torque, mechanical precision
   - Trade-offs: Magnetic performance vs manufacturing cost vs reliability

3. **Winding Configuration Cable**:
   - Source: Back-EMF shape requirements and available space
   - Propagates to: Power electronics complexity, copper losses, thermal management
   - Criticality: Determines motor's electrical "language" with controller

### Motor Design Dependency Network:
Every motor design decision pulls multiple cables simultaneously:

**Pole Count Decision** → affects:
- Operating speed range (synchronous speed = 120f/poles)
- Winding complexity and copper usage
- Magnet quantity and cost
- Cogging torque and smoothness
- Power electronics switching frequency requirements

**Magnet Selection** → affects:
- Air gap flux density and torque capability
- Operating temperature limits and thermal design
- Cost and material supply chain
- Demagnetization risk and fault tolerance

**Immediate Context Retrieval** (Read now):
- Torque/speed requirements outside standard motor capabilities
- Conflicting specifications (high torque + small size + low cost)
- Unusual operating environment (high temperature, vacuum, extreme duty)
- First-time topology (new to specific motor type)

**Consider Reading** (Moderate uncertainty):
- Performance targets at limits of chosen topology
- Multi-physics coupling issues (electromagnetic-thermal-mechanical)
- Manufacturing constraints affecting design choices
- Cost/performance trade-offs need optimization

Motor design inherently involves coupled physics that creates complex dependency networks:

### Electromagnetic → Thermal Coupling:
- Copper losses (I²R) create heat in windings
- Iron losses (hysteresis + eddy current) heat stator core  
- Heat affects magnet strength and copper resistance
- Thermal expansion changes air gap clearances

### Thermal → Mechanical Coupling:
- Thermal expansion affects fits and clearances
- Temperature gradients create stress and distortion
- Cooling requirements drive housing design
- Thermal time constants affect transient performance

### Mechanical → Electromagnetic Coupling:  
- Manufacturing tolerances affect air gap uniformity
- Mechanical resonances interact with electromagnetic forces
- Bearing selection affects rotor dynamics and alignment
- Housing materials affect magnetic circuit paths
