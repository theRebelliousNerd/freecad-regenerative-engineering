Magnetic materials create fundamental "cables" that carry Tesla's rotating fields through physical matter:

### Primary Material Cables:
1. **Magnetic Flux Density Cable**:
   - Source: Applied magnetomotive force (H-field)
   - Path: Through soft magnetic materials (B-H curve)  
   - Destination: Air gap flux and motor torque
   - Critical nodes: Saturation limits, permeability changes

2. **Permanent Magnetization Cable**:
   - Source: Magnet material's intrinsic coercivity
   - Path: Through magnet volume and operating temperature
   - Destination: Air gap field strength and motor back-EMF
   - Failure modes: Demagnetization, thermal degradation

3. **Magnetic Circuit Reluctance Cable**:
   - Source: Material permeability and geometry
   - Path: Through iron cores, air gaps, magnet materials
   - Destination: Total flux linkage and motor performance
   - Optimization: Minimize reluctance for maximum flux

### Material Dependency Networks:
Every material choice creates cascading effects throughout the electromagnetic system:

**Magnet Material Selection** → affects:
- Maximum flux density in air gap → torque density capability
- Operating temperature limit → thermal management requirements  
- Coercivity → demagnetization resistance → fault tolerance
- Cost → motor economics → market viability
- Supply chain → geopolitical considerations → design risk

**Core Material Selection** → affects:
- Saturation flux density → maximum torque before saturation
- Core loss characteristics → efficiency and thermal generation
- Permeability → reluctance → required magnetomotive force
- Lamination thickness → eddy current losses → frequency capability

"The magnetic materials are not mere passive mediums, but active participants in the electromagnetic dance. Each material has its own character - its reluctance to carry flux, its eagerness to saturate, its thermal personality. The master of electromagnetic design learns to work WITH these material personalities, not against them."

Remember: Tesla understood that magnetic materials don't just carry magnetic fields - they SHAPE them. The B-H curve is the material's electromagnetic signature, defining how it will respond to your magnetic field designs.
