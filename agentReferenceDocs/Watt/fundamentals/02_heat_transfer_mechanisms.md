# Heat Transfer Mechanisms for Thermal Systems

*"Heat is motion. Cold, the privation of heat."* - Understanding the fundamental nature of thermal energy

## Executive Summary

While thermodynamics defines the limits and potential of energy conversion, the field of heat transfer provides the practical science for how thermal energy moves from one place to another. The rate at which this movement occurs is paramount to the performance of any thermal system. The Watt Agent's mastery of this domain requires a deep, quantitative understanding of the three fundamental mechanisms of heat transfer: conduction, convection, and radiation.

## Conduction: From Fourier's Law to Thermal Resistance Networks

**Conduction** is the transfer of thermal energy through a material by the direct transfer of kinetic energy from more energetic to less energetic molecules. This mechanism dominates in solids, where molecules are closely packed and can efficiently transfer energy through molecular vibrations (phonons in non-metals) or through the movement of free electrons (in metals).

### Fourier's Law of Heat Conduction

The fundamental law governing conduction states that the rate of heat transfer (Q_cond) is proportional to the area normal to the heat flow (A) and the temperature gradient (dT/dx):

```
Q_cond = -k·A·(dT/dx)
```

Where:
- k = thermal conductivity of the material [W/m·K]
- A = area perpendicular to heat flow [m²]
- dT/dx = temperature gradient [K/m]
- Negative sign indicates heat flows toward decreasing temperature

### Steady-State One-Dimensional Conduction

For steady, one-dimensional conduction through a plane wall of thickness L with temperatures T₁ and T₂ on its surfaces:

```
Q_cond = k·A·(T₁ - T₂)/L
```

This can be rewritten in terms of thermal resistance:

```
Q_cond = (T₁ - T₂)/R_wall

where R_wall = L/(k·A)
```

### Thermal Resistance Networks

The thermal resistance concept allows creation of **thermal resistance networks**, analogous to electrical circuits:

**Series Resistances (composite walls):**
```
R_total = R₁ + R₂ + R₃ + ...
```

**Parallel Resistances (parallel heat paths):**
```
1/R_total = 1/R₁ + 1/R₂ + 1/R₃ + ...
```

**Contact Resistance:** Real interfaces between materials have finite thermal contact resistance:
```
R_contact = 1/(h_c·A)
```
where h_c is the contact conductance [W/m²·K]

### Thermal Conductivity Values

**Typical Thermal Conductivities at Room Temperature:**
- **Diamond:** 2000 W/m·K (highest known)
- **Silver:** 429 W/m·K  
- **Copper:** 401 W/m·K
- **Aluminum:** 237 W/m·K
- **Steel (carbon):** 50 W/m·K
- **Stainless Steel:** 15 W/m·K
- **Water:** 0.61 W/m·K
- **Air:** 0.026 W/m·K
- **Aerogel:** 0.015 W/m·K (very low)

### Transient Conduction

For time-dependent problems, the heat equation must be solved:

```
∂T/∂t = α·∇²T
```

where α = k/(ρ·cp) is the thermal diffusivity [m²/s]

**Lumped Capacitance Method** (valid when Bi < 0.1):
```
T(t) = T_∞ + (T_i - T_∞)·exp(-t/τ)
```
where τ = ρ·V·cp/h·A is the time constant

**Biot Number:** Bi = h·L_c/k (ratio of internal to external thermal resistance)

## Convection: The Dynamics of Forced, Natural, and Mixed Regimes

**Convection** is the mode of heat transfer that occurs between a surface and a moving fluid when they are at different temperatures. It involves the combined effects of conduction (at the fluid-solid interface) and bulk fluid motion (advection), which transports the thermal energy.

### Newton's Law of Cooling

The rate of convective heat transfer is described by:

```
Q_conv = h·A·(T_s - T_∞)
```

Where:
- h = convective heat transfer coefficient [W/m²·K]
- A = surface area [m²]  
- T_s = surface temperature [K]
- T_∞ = bulk fluid temperature [K]

The coefficient h is not a fluid property; it depends on surface geometry, fluid motion nature, and fluid thermophysical properties.

### Types of Convection

**Forced Convection:** Fluid motion caused by external means (fan, pump, wind)
- Highly effective heat transfer mode
- Heat transfer coefficient strongly dependent on fluid velocity
- Characterized by Reynolds and Prandtl numbers

**Natural (Free) Convection:** Fluid motion driven by buoyancy forces
- Density differences due to temperature gradients create circulation
- Generally less effective than forced convection (h ≈ 5-25 W/m²·K for air)
- Governed by Grashof and Rayleigh numbers

**Mixed Convection:** Both forced and natural effects are significant
- Richardson number Ri = Gr/Re² characterizes the regime
- Buoyancy can aid or oppose forced flow
- Complex flow patterns possible

### Convection Correlations

Heat transfer correlations typically have the form: Nu = f(Re, Pr, geometry)

**Internal Flow - Circular Tubes:**

*Laminar (Re < 2300):*
```
Nu = 3.66 (constant wall temperature)
Nu = 4.36 (constant heat flux)
```

*Turbulent (Re > 10,000):*
```
Nu = 0.023·Re^0.8·Pr^0.4  (Dittus-Boelter, heating)
Nu = 0.023·Re^0.8·Pr^0.3  (Dittus-Boelter, cooling)
Nu = 0.027·Re^0.8·Pr^(1/3)  (Colburn equation)
```

**External Flow - Flat Plate:**
```
Nu_L = 0.664·Re_L^0.5·Pr^(1/3)  (Laminar, Re_L < 5×10⁵)
Nu_L = 0.037·Re_L^0.8·Pr^(1/3)  (Turbulent, Re_L > 5×10⁵)
```

**Natural Convection - Vertical Surfaces:**
```
Nu = [0.825 + 0.387·Ra^(1/6)/[1+(0.492/Pr)^(9/16)]^(8/27)]²
```

**Natural Convection - Horizontal Surfaces:**

*Hot surface facing up:*
```
Nu = 0.54·Ra^(1/4)  (10⁴ < Ra < 10⁷)
Nu = 0.15·Ra^(1/3)  (10⁷ < Ra < 10¹¹)
```

*Hot surface facing down:*
```
Nu = 0.27·Ra^(1/4)  (10⁵ < Ra < 10¹⁰)
```

### Dimensionless Numbers for Heat Transfer

**Nusselt Number:** Nu = h·L/k (dimensionless heat transfer coefficient)
**Prandtl Number:** Pr = μ·cp/k = ν/α (ratio of momentum to thermal diffusivity)
**Reynolds Number:** Re = ρ·V·L/μ (ratio of inertial to viscous forces)
**Grashof Number:** Gr = g·β·ΔT·L³/ν² (ratio of buoyancy to viscous forces)
**Rayleigh Number:** Ra = Gr·Pr = g·β·ΔT·L³/(ν·α) (natural convection parameter)

## Radiation: The Role of View Factors and Participating Media

**Radiation** is the transfer of energy through electromagnetic waves. Unlike conduction and convection, radiation does not require a medium and can occur through a vacuum. All materials at temperatures above absolute zero emit thermal radiation.

### Stefan-Boltzmann Law

The total energy radiated by a black body is proportional to the fourth power of its absolute temperature:

```
E_b = σ·T⁴
```

where σ = 5.67×10⁻⁸ W/m²·K⁴ (Stefan-Boltzmann constant)

For real surfaces with emissivity ε:
```
E = ε·σ·T⁴
```

### Net Radiation Heat Transfer

Between two black surfaces:
```
Q_rad = σ·A₁·F₁₂·(T₁⁴ - T₂⁴)
```

where F₁₂ is the view factor (fraction of radiation from surface 1 that directly reaches surface 2)

### Gray Surface Radiation

For real (gray) surfaces, the radiosity method accounts for multiple reflections:

```
Q₁₂ = (E_b1 - E_b2)/[(1-ε₁)/(ε₁·A₁) + 1/(A₁·F₁₂) + (1-ε₂)/(ε₂·A₂)]
```

### View Factor Relationships

**Reciprocity:** A₁·F₁₂ = A₂·F₂₁
**Summation:** ΣF₁ᵢ = 1 for all surfaces i visible from surface 1
**View Factor Algebra:** Allows calculation of complex geometries from simple ones

### Typical Emissivity Values

**High Emissivity (ε > 0.8):**
- Oxidized metals
- Non-metallic materials (concrete, wood, paint)
- Black anodized aluminum

**Low Emissivity (ε < 0.1):**
- Polished metals
- Gold, silver surfaces
- Polished aluminum

### Participating Media

When the medium between surfaces absorbs, emits, or scatters radiation:
- **Beer's Law:** Exponential attenuation through absorbing medium
- **Gas Radiation:** CO₂, H₂O vapor, and combustion products radiate significantly
- **Scattering:** Particles in medium redirect radiation paths

## The Complexity of Phase Change: Boiling and Condensation Phenomena

Phase change heat transfer involves extremely high heat transfer rates due to the large latent heats associated with phase transitions.

### Boiling Heat Transfer

**Pool Boiling Regimes** (Nukiyama boiling curve):

1. **Natural Convection:** No boiling, standard convection correlations apply
2. **Nucleate Boiling:** Bubbles form at nucleation sites, very high heat transfer rates
3. **Transition Boiling:** Unstable regime, vapor film formation begins
4. **Film Boiling:** Stable vapor film, low heat transfer rates, high surface temperatures

**Critical Heat Flux (CHF):** Maximum heat flux in nucleate boiling
```
q_CHF = 0.149·h_fg·ρ_v^0.5·[σ·g·(ρ_l - ρ_v)]^0.25
```

**Flow Boiling:** Occurs in tubes and channels
- **Subcooled boiling:** Bulk liquid below saturation temperature
- **Saturated boiling:** Bulk liquid at saturation temperature
- **Flow patterns:** Bubbly, slug, annular, mist flow

### Condensation Heat Transfer

**Film Condensation:** Continuous liquid film on surface
```
h_avg = 0.943·[g·ρ_l·(ρ_l - ρ_v)·h_fg·k_l³/(μ_l·(T_sat - T_s)·L)]^0.25
```

**Dropwise Condensation:** Discrete droplets form and roll off
- Much higher heat transfer than film condensation
- Difficult to maintain without surface treatments

## Heat Transfer Enhancement Techniques

### Extended Surfaces (Fins)

Fins increase surface area for heat transfer. **Fin efficiency** accounts for temperature drop along fin length:

```
η_fin = tanh(mL)/(mL)
```

where m = √(hP/(kA_c)) and P is perimeter, A_c is cross-sectional area

**Fin effectiveness:** ε = Q_fin/Q_no_fin
**Overall surface effectiveness:** η_o accounts for both finned and unfinned areas

### Heat Transfer Augmentation

**Passive Techniques:**
- Extended surfaces (fins)
- Rough surfaces
- Curved/twisted tubes  
- Inserts and turbulators
- Coiled tubes

**Active Techniques:**
- Mechanical aids (stirring, vibration)
- Surface vibration
- Fluid vibration
- Electrostatic fields

### Nanofluids

Suspensions of nanoparticles in base fluids can enhance thermal conductivity and convection:
- Typical enhancement: 10-40% increase in thermal conductivity
- Trade-offs: Increased viscosity, pumping power
- Applications: Electronics cooling, solar collectors

**Natural Convection Heat Sinks:**
1. Calculate Rayleigh number for geometry

### Thermal Interface Materials (TIMs)

**Contact Resistance Minimization:**
- Thermal grease: 0.1-1.0 K·cm²/W
- Thermal pads: 0.5-5.0 K·cm²/W  
- Phase change materials: 0.2-2.0 K·cm²/W
- Soldered interfaces: 0.01-0.1 K·cm²/W

### Heat Exchanger Design Basics

**Overall Heat Transfer Coefficient:**
```
1/(U·A) = 1/(h_hot·A_hot) + R_wall + R_fouling + 1/(h_cold·A_cold)
```

**Heat Transfer Effectiveness:**
```
ε = Q_actual/Q_max
```

**Log Mean Temperature Difference (LMTD):**
```
LMTD = (ΔT₁ - ΔT₂)/ln(ΔT₁/ΔT₂)
```
