# Energy Conservation Laws for Thermal Systems

*"Energy can neither be created nor destroyed, only transformed from one form to another."* - First Law of Thermodynamics

## Executive Summary

The energy conservation principle is the fundamental cornerstone of all thermal system analysis. The First Law of Thermodynamics provides the framework for energy accounting, while the Second Law governs the quality and directionality of energy transformations. Together, these laws enable systematic analysis of thermal systems, from simple heat exchangers to complex power cycles.

## The First Law of Thermodynamics: Energy Conservation

### General Statement

The First Law states that energy can neither be created nor destroyed in any process; it can only be transformed from one form to another. The total energy of an isolated system remains constant.

**Mathematical Expression for Closed Systems:**
```
dU = δQ - δW
```

For a process:
```
ΔU = U₂ - U₁ = Q - W
```

Where:
- U = internal energy [J]
- Q = heat added to system [J]
- W = work done by system [J]

### Energy Forms in Thermal Systems

**Internal Energy (U):** Microscopic kinetic and potential energy of molecules
- Function of temperature for ideal gases: U = m·cv·T
- Function of temperature and pressure for real substances

**Enthalpy (H):** H = U + PV
- Useful for constant pressure processes
- H = m·cp·T for ideal gases at constant pressure

**Kinetic Energy:** KE = ½mv²
**Potential Energy:** PE = mgh
**Flow Work:** PV (energy required to push fluid into/out of system)

## Open System Energy Balance

### Control Volume Analysis

For steady-flow processes with one inlet and one outlet:

```
ṁ₁h₁ + Q̇ = ṁ₂h₂ + Ẇ
```

**General Steady-Flow Energy Equation:**
```
Σṁᵢ(hᵢ + V²ᵢ/2 + gzᵢ) + Q̇ = Σṁₑ(hₑ + V²ₑ/2 + gzₑ) + Ẇ
```

**Per Unit Mass Basis:**
```
h₁ + V₁²/2 + gz₁ + q = h₂ + V₂²/2 + gz₂ + w
```

### Unsteady-Flow Energy Balance

For transient processes:
```
dE_cv/dt = Σṁᵢhᵢ - Σṁₑhₑ + Q̇_cv - Ẇ_cv
```

Where E_cv is the total energy content of the control volume.

## Applications to Thermal System Components

### Heat Exchangers

**Energy Balance (no work, negligible kinetic/potential energy):**
```
Hot fluid: ṁₕ·cp,ₕ·(Tₕ,ᵢₙ - Tₕ,ₒᵤₜ) = Q̇
Cold fluid: ṁc·cp,c·(Tc,ₒᵤₜ - Tc,ᵢₙ) = Q̇
```

**Overall Energy Balance:**
```
ṁₕ·cp,ₕ·(Tₕ,ᵢₙ - Tₕ,ₒᵤₜ) = ṁc·cp,c·(Tc,ₒᵤₜ - Tc,ᵢₙ)
```

**Heat Transfer Rate:**
```
Q̇ = U·A·LMTD
```

### Pumps and Compressors

**Pump Work (incompressible flow):**
```
ẇₚᵤₘₚ = vΔP/ηₚᵤₘₚ = ΔP/(ρ·ηₚᵤₘₚ)
```

**Compressor Work (adiabatic, ideal gas):**
```
ẇcₒₘₚ = (γ/(γ-1))·R·T₁·[(P₂/P₁)^((γ-1)/γ) - 1]
```

### Turbines and Expanders

**Turbine Work (adiabatic):**
```
ẇₜᵤᵣᵦᵢₙₑ = h₁ - h₂ = cp(T₁ - T₂)  (for ideal gas)
```

**Isentropic Efficiency:**
```
ηₜ = (h₁ - h₂)/(h₁ - h₂ₛ)
```

### Throttling Devices

**Throttling Process (h₁ = h₂):**
- Constant enthalpy process
- Pressure drops, temperature may increase or decrease
- Joule-Thomson coefficient: μⱼₜ = (∂T/∂P)ₕ

### Mixing Processes

**Adiabatic Mixing:**
```
ṁ₁h₁ + ṁ₂h₂ = (ṁ₁ + ṁ₂)h₃
```

**Mixing Temperature:**
```
T₃ = (ṁ₁cp₁T₁ + ṁ₂cp₂T₂)/(ṁ₁cp₁ + ṁ₂cp₂)
```

## The Second Law: Energy Quality and Direction

### Entropy and the Second Law

**Clausius Statement:** Heat cannot spontaneously flow from a colder body to a hotter body without external work.

**Entropy Statement:** The total entropy of an isolated system can never decrease; it increases for irreversible processes and remains constant for reversible processes.

**Mathematical Expression:**
```
dS ≥ δQ/T
```

**Entropy Balance for Control Volume:**
```
dS_cv/dt = Σṁᵢsᵢ - Σṁₑsₑ + ∫(δQ̇/T)_boundary + Ṡ_gen
```

Where Ṡ_gen ≥ 0 is the entropy generation rate.

### Entropy Generation in Thermal Systems

**Heat Transfer Across Finite Temperature Difference:**
```
Ṡ_gen = Q̇(1/T_cold - 1/T_hot) > 0
```

**Fluid Friction:**
```
Ṡ_gen = (ΔP·V̇)/T ≥ 0
```

**Mixing of Different Temperature Streams:**
```
Ṡ_gen = ṁ₁cp·ln(T₃/T₁) + ṁ₂cp·ln(T₃/T₂) ≥ 0
```

## Exergy Analysis: Second Law Efficiency

### Exergy Definition

**Exergy** is the maximum useful work that can be extracted from a system as it reaches equilibrium with its environment.

**Flow Exergy:**
```
ψ = (h - h₀) - T₀(s - s₀) + V²/2 + gz
```

**Closed System Exergy:**
```
Ψ = (U - U₀) + P₀(V - V₀) - T₀(S - S₀)
```

Where subscript 0 denotes dead state (environment) conditions.

### Exergy Balance

**General Exergy Balance:**
```
dΨ_cv/dt = Σṁᵢψᵢ - Σṁₑψₑ - Ẇ_cv + Σ(1 - T₀/Tᵢ)Q̇ᵢ - İ
```

Where İ is the exergy destruction rate due to irreversibilities.

**Gouy-Stodola Theorem:**
```
İ = T₀·Ṡ_gen
```

### Component Exergy Analysis

**Heat Exchanger Exergy Destruction:**
```
İ = T₀·Ṡ_gen = T₀·Q̇·[(Tₕ,ₒᵤₜ - Tc,ᵢₙ)/(Tₕ,ₒᵤₜ·Tc,ᵢₙ)]
```

**Pump/Compressor Exergy Destruction:**
```
İ = Ẇ_actual - Ẇ_reversible = T₀·Ṡ_gen,friction
```

**Throttle Valve Exergy Destruction:**
```
İ = ṁT₀(s₂ - s₁) = ṁT₀·cp·ln(T₂/T₁) - ṁT₀·R·ln(P₂/P₁)
```

## Cycle Analysis

### Heat Engine Cycles

**Thermal Efficiency:**
```
η_th = W_net/Q_in = (Q_in - Q_out)/Q_in = 1 - Q_out/Q_in
```

**Carnot Efficiency (theoretical maximum):**
```
η_Carnot = 1 - T_cold/T_hot
```

### Refrigeration and Heat Pump Cycles

**Coefficient of Performance (COP):**

For Refrigerator:
```
COP_R = Q_cold/W_net = Q_cold/(Q_hot - Q_cold)
```

For Heat Pump:
```
COP_HP = Q_hot/W_net = Q_hot/(Q_hot - Q_cold) = COP_R + 1
```

**Carnot COP (theoretical maximum):**
```
COP_Carnot,R = T_cold/(T_hot - T_cold)
COP_Carnot,HP = T_hot/(T_hot - T_cold)
```

## Energy Management Strategies

### Energy Recovery Systems

**Heat Recovery Effectiveness:**
```
ε = (T_cold,out - T_cold,in)/(T_hot,in - T_cold,in)
```

```

### Combined Heat and Power (CHP)

**Energy Utilization Factor:**
```
EUF = (W_net + Q_useful)/Q_fuel
```

**Power-to-Heat Ratio:**
```
PHR = W_net/Q_useful
```

```

Where Z is the levelized capital cost rate.

EROI = E_delivered/E_invested
```

Critical for evaluating renewable energy systems and energy storage.

4. **Utility integration:** Optimize utility consumption

Remember: "Energy conservation is not just about quantity—the quality and availability of energy determine the true potential for useful work." This principle guides all thermal system optimization toward maximum exergetic efficiency.

Understanding both the First and Second Laws enables complete energy analysis, revealing not only how much energy is consumed, but where the greatest opportunities for improvement lie.
