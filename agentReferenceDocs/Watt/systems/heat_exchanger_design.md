# Heat Exchanger Design Principles

*"Heat must flow from hot to cold, but the path determines efficiency."* - Watt's Heat Exchanger Design Principle

## Executive Summary

Heat exchangers are the fundamental components that enable efficient thermal energy transfer between fluid streams. Design optimization requires understanding heat transfer mechanisms, pressure drop relationships, and the trade-offs between thermal performance, cost, and manufacturability. This guide provides systematic methodology for heat exchanger selection, sizing, and optimization.

## Heat Exchanger Classification System

### Flow Configuration Types

**Parallel Flow (Co-current)**
```
Hot fluid: T_h,in → T_h,out
Cold fluid: T_c,in → T_c,out

## Heat Exchanger Sizing Methodology

### Fundamental Design Equation

**Basic Heat Transfer Rate:**
```
Q = UA × LMTD × F
```
Where:
- Q = heat transfer rate [W]
- U = overall heat transfer coefficient [W/m²·K]
- A = heat transfer surface area [m²]
- LMTD = log mean temperature difference [K]
- F = correction factor for flow configuration

### Heat Balance Equations

**Hot Side:**
```
Q = m_h × cp_h × (T_h,in - T_h,out)
```

**Cold Side:**
```
Q = m_c × cp_c × (T_c,out - T_c,in)
```

**Steady State Requirement:**
```
Q_hot = Q_cold = Q_heat_exchanger
```

### Log Mean Temperature Difference (LMTD)

**Counter Flow:**
```
LMTD = (ΔT_1 - ΔT_2) / ln(ΔT_1/ΔT_2)

where:
ΔT_1 = T_h,in - T_c,out
ΔT_2 = T_h,out - T_c,in
```

**Parallel Flow:**
```
LMTD = (ΔT_1 - ΔT_2) / ln(ΔT_1/ΔT_2)

where:
ΔT_1 = T_h,in - T_c,in
ΔT_2 = T_h,out - T_c,out
```

### Effectiveness-NTU Method

**Heat Exchanger Effectiveness:**
```
ε = Q_actual / Q_maximum
Q_maximum = C_min × (T_h,in - T_c,in)
```

**Number of Transfer Units (NTU):**
```
NTU = UA / C_min
where C_min = min(m_h×cp_h, m_c×cp_c)
```

**Capacity Rate Ratio:**
```
C_r = C_min / C_max
```

**Effectiveness Relations:**

*Counter Flow:*
```
ε = (1 - exp[-NTU(1-C_r)]) / (1 - C_r×exp[-NTU(1-C_r)])  for C_r ≠ 1
ε = NTU / (1 + NTU)  for C_r = 1
```

*Parallel Flow:*
```
ε = (1 - exp[-NTU(1+C_r)]) / (1 + C_r)
```

*Cross Flow (both unmixed):*
```
ε = 1 - exp[(NTU^0.22/C_r) × (exp[-C_r×NTU^0.78] - 1)]
```

## Overall Heat Transfer Coefficient Calculation

### Thermal Resistance Network

**For Tube-in-Tube Heat Exchanger:**
```
1/UA = 1/(h_i×A_i) + t_wall/(k_wall×A_lm) + 1/(h_o×A_o) + R_fouling
```

Where:
- h_i, h_o = inside and outside heat transfer coefficients
- A_i, A_o = inside and outside surface areas
- A_lm = log mean surface area = (A_o - A_i)/ln(A_o/A_i)
- R_fouling = fouling resistance (typically 0.0001-0.001 m²K/W)

### Heat Transfer Coefficient Correlations

**Internal Flow - Tubes (Turbulent, Re > 10,000):**
```
Nu = 0.023 × Re^0.8 × Pr^0.4  (Dittus-Boelter)
h = Nu × k / D_hydraulic
```

**External Flow - Cross-flow Over Tube Bundles:**
```
Nu = 0.27 × Re_D^0.63 × Pr^0.36  (for staggered tubes)
Nu = 0.26 × Re_D^0.60 × Pr^0.36  (for inline tubes)
```

**Natural Convection - Vertical Surfaces:**
```
Nu = 0.59 × Ra^0.25  (10^4 < Ra < 10^9, laminar)
Nu = 0.13 × Ra^0.33  (10^9 < Ra < 10^12, turbulent)
```

### Fin Effectiveness and Efficiency

**Straight Rectangular Fin:**
```
η_fin = tanh(mL) / (mL)
where m = √(h×p / k×A_c)
```

**Overall Fin Efficiency:**
```
η_o = 1 - (A_fin/A_total) × (1 - η_fin)
```

**Finned Surface Heat Transfer:**
```
h_effective = h × η_o
```

## Pressure Drop Analysis

### Friction Factor Correlations

**Smooth Tubes (Turbulent):**
```
f = 0.316 / Re^0.25  (Re < 2×10^5)
f = 0.184 / Re^0.2   (Re > 2×10^5)
```

**Tube Bundles (Cross-flow):**
```
f = f_0 × Re^(-0.15)
where f_0 depends on tube arrangement and spacing
```

### Pressure Drop Calculations

**Internal Flow:**
```
ΔP = f × (L/D) × (ρ×V²/2) + entrance/exit losses
```

**External Flow (Tube Bundle):**
```
ΔP = f × N_rows × (ρ×V_max²/2)
where V_max = maximum velocity between tubes
```

**Air-Side Pressure Drop (Finned Surfaces):**
```
ΔP = (G²/ρ_in) × [(1-σ²) + f×(A/A_c)×(ρ_in/ρ_out) + (ρ_in/ρ_out - 1)]
```

Where:
- G = mass velocity [kg/m²·s]
- σ = free-flow area ratio
- A/A_c = heat transfer area to core frontal area ratio

## Heat Exchanger Selection Guidelines

### Performance vs Cost Trade-offs

**Cost Drivers:**
1. **Heat transfer area**: Larger area = higher cost
2. **Material selection**: Copper > aluminum > steel
3. **Manufacturing complexity**: Brazed > welded > mechanical assembly
4. **Pressure drop**: Higher ΔP = larger pumps/fans = higher operating cost

**Performance Optimization:**
```
Performance Index = Q / (Cost_capital + Cost_operating×PV_factor)
```

## Design Examples and Calculations

### Example 1: Air-Cooled Heat Exchanger Sizing

**Given:**
- Heat load: Q = 5000W
- Hot fluid: Water, 80°C inlet, 60°C outlet
- Cold fluid: Air, 25°C inlet, forced convection
- Target: Size finned-tube heat exchanger

**Solution:**
1. **Hot side heat capacity rate:**
   ```
   C_h = Q/(T_h,in - T_h,out) = 5000/(80-60) = 250 W/K
   ```

2. **Required air temperature rise:**
   ```
   Assume C_r = 0.5, then C_c = C_h/2 = 125 W/K
   T_c,out = T_c,in + Q/C_c = 25 + 5000/125 = 65°C
   ```

3. **LMTD calculation:**
   ```
   ΔT_1 = 80 - 65 = 15°C
   ΔT_2 = 60 - 25 = 35°C
   LMTD = (35-15)/ln(35/15) = 23.7°C
   ```

4. **Required UA:**
   ```
   UA = Q/LMTD = 5000/23.7 = 211 W/K
   ```

### Example 2: Plate Heat Exchanger Design

**Given:**
- Heat duty: Q = 100kW
- Hot water: 90°C → 70°C
- Cold water: 15°C → 35°C
- Target effectiveness: 0.8

**Solution:**
1. **Heat capacity rates:**
   ```
   C_h = 100,000/(90-70) = 5000 W/K
   C_c = 100,000/(35-15) = 5000 W/K
   C_min = C_max = 5000 W/K, so C_r = 1
   ```

2. **Required NTU for counter-flow:**
   ```
   ε = 0.8, C_r = 1
   NTU = ε/(1-ε) = 0.8/0.2 = 4.0
   ```

3. **Required UA:**
   ```
   UA = NTU × C_min = 4.0 × 5000 = 20,000 W/K
   ```
