# HVAC System Integration for Thermal Management

*"The art of HVAC design lies in balancing comfort, efficiency, and cost within the constraints of physics."* - Systems integration principles

## Executive Summary

Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems are responsible for a significant portion of global energy consumption. Designing efficient and effective HVAC systems requires a synthesis of thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, heat transfer, and psychrometrics. The Watt Agent approaches HVAC design as a complete system integration challenge, optimizing performance while minimizing energy consumption.

## HVAC System Fundamentals

### Load Calculations

The first step in HVAC design is performing detailed **heating and cooling load calculations** for the building. This involves quantifying all sources of heat gain and loss:

**Heat Gain Sources:**
- **Solar radiation** through windows and building envelope
- **Internal heat** from occupants and equipment  
- **Conduction** through walls, roofs, and floors
- **Infiltration** of outside air through leaks
- **Ventilation** air required for indoor air quality

**Heat Loss Sources:**
- **Conduction** through building envelope
- **Infiltration** and **exfiltration** air leakage
- **Ventilation** air heating requirements

**Load Calculation Methods:**
- **ASHRAE Heat Balance Method:** Hour-by-hour calculations considering thermal mass
- **Cooling Load Temperature Difference (CLTD):** Simplified method for peak loads
- **Bin Method:** For annual energy consumption estimates

### HVAC System Types

**Central Systems:**
- **All-Air Systems:** Supply conditioned air only
- **Air-Water Systems:** Both air and hydronic distribution
- **All-Water Systems:** Hydronic heating/cooling only

**Unitary Systems:**
- **Packaged Units:** Self-contained systems
- **Split Systems:** Indoor and outdoor units connected
- **Heat Pumps:** Reversible refrigeration cycles

**Hybrid Systems:**
- **Variable Refrigerant Flow (VRF):** Multiple indoor units, one outdoor unit
- **Radiant Systems:** Combined with ventilation air systems
- **Geothermal Systems:** Ground-source heat pumps

## Psychrometrics: The Science of Moist Air

### Psychrometric Properties

**Dry-Bulb Temperature (T_db):** Standard air temperature measurement [°C]

**Wet-Bulb Temperature (T_wb):** Lowest temperature achievable by evaporate cooling [°C]

**Humidity Ratio (W):** Mass of water vapor per mass of dry air [kg_w/kg_da]
```
W = 0.622 × P_v/(P - P_v)
```

**Relative Humidity (φ):** Ratio of actual to saturated humidity ratio [%]
```
φ = W/W_sat × 100%
```

**Enthalpy of Moist Air (h):** Total heat content [kJ/kg_da]
```
h = cp,a × T + W × (h_fg + cp,v × T)
```
where:
- cp,a = 1.006 kJ/kg·K (specific heat of dry air)
- h_fg ≈ 2501 kJ/kg (latent heat of vaporization at 0°C)
- cp,v = 1.86 kJ/kg·K (specific heat of water vapor)

**Dew Point Temperature (T_dp):** Temperature at which water vapor condenses [°C]

### Psychrometric Processes

**Sensible Heating/Cooling:** Constant humidity ratio
- Process line: Horizontal on psychrometric chart
- No moisture addition or removal

**Humidification/Dehumidification:** Constant dry-bulb temperature
- Process line: Vertical on psychrometric chart
- Steam or evaporative humidification

**Evaporative Cooling:** Constant wet-bulb temperature
- Process line: Along constant enthalpy (approximately)
- Adiabatic saturation process

**Heating with Humidification:** Combined sensible and latent load
- Process line: Slope depends on sensible heat ratio (SHR)

**Cooling with Dehumidification:** Air cooled below dew point
- Two-stage process: sensible cooling then latent removal
- Apparatus dew point determines final conditions

### Sensible Heat Ratio

**Definition:**
```
SHR = Q_sensible/(Q_sensible + Q_latent)
```

**Typical Values:**
- **Offices:** SHR = 0.75-0.85
- **Retail spaces:** SHR = 0.65-0.75  
- **Restaurants:** SHR = 0.55-0.70
- **Hospitals:** SHR = 0.70-0.80

## HVAC System Design Process

```

**Peak Load Timing:**

- Consider thermal mass effects

### Step 2: System Selection

**Selection Criteria:**

- **Controls Optimization:** Smart scheduling and setbacks

### Step 3: Equipment Sizing

**Air Handler Sizing:**
```
CFM_supply = Q_cooling/(1.08 × ΔT)
```
where 1.08 is the air constant for standard conditions.

**Cooling Coil Sizing:**
```
Q_coil = CFM × 4.5 × Δh
```
where 4.5 converts CFM·Btu/lb to Btu/hr, and Δh is enthalpy difference.

**Heating Coil Sizing:**
```
Q_heating = CFM × 1.08 × ΔT
```

### Step 4: Distribution System Design

**Ductwork Design:**
- **Equal friction method:** Constant pressure drop per unit length
- **Static regain method:** Maintains constant static pressure
- **T-method:** Total pressure balancing approach

**Hydronic System Design:**
- **Primary/secondary pumping:** Decouples production from distribution
- **Variable flow systems:** Reduce pumping energy
- **Temperature differential:** Optimize for system efficiency

## Energy Recovery Systems

### Heat Recovery Ventilator (HRV)

**Sensible Heat Recovery Only:**
```
ε_sensible = (T_supply - T_outdoor)/(T_exhaust - T_outdoor)
```

**Typical Effectiveness:** 60-80% for sensible heat recovery

**Applications:**
- Cold climates where latent recovery not beneficial
- Balanced ventilation systems
- Reduces heating energy consumption

### Energy Recovery Ventilator (ERV)

**Total Energy Recovery:** Both sensible and latent heat transfer
```
ε_total = (h_supply - h_outdoor)/(h_exhaust - h_outdoor)
```

**Typical Effectiveness:** 70-85% for total energy recovery

**Applications:**
- Hot, humid climates
- Buildings with high internal moisture loads
- Reduces both heating and cooling energy

### Recovery System Types
