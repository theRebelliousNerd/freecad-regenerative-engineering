# Validation and Verification Protocols for Thermal Systems

*"Trust, but verify. In thermal analysis, verification ensures we solve the equations correctly, while validation ensures we solve the right equations."* - CFD Quality Assurance Principles

## Executive Summary

Verification and Validation (V&V) are formal processes essential for establishing confidence in computational thermal analysis results. Verification answers "Are we solving the equations correctly?" while validation addresses "Are we solving the right equations?" The Watt Agent implements rigorous V&V protocols to ensure reliable, accurate, and defensible thermal system designs.

## Verification and Validation Framework

## Code Verification Protocols

### Analytical Solution Benchmarks

**Heat Conduction Test Cases:**

**1D Steady Conduction:**
```
Analytical: T(x) = T₁ + (T₂-T₁)·x/L
Verification: Compare computed vs. analytical temperature profile
Acceptable Error: < 1% of temperature difference
```

**1D Transient Conduction (Semi-infinite):**
```
Analytical: T(x,t) = T_i + (T_s-T_i)·erfc(x/(2√(αt)))
Verification: Compare temperature history at multiple locations
Grid Resolution: Ensure Δx < penetration depth/20
```

**2D Steady Conduction (Corner Problem):**
```
Analytical: T(x,y) = (4T₀/π)∑[(sin(nπx/L)sinh(nπy/L))/(n·sinh(nπ))]
Verification: Check temperature distribution and heat flux
Convergence: Refine grid until change < 0.5%
```

**Convection Test Cases:**

**Forced Convection in Pipe:**
```
Analytical: Nu = 3.66 (laminar, constant wall temperature)
Verification: Compare computed Nu with analytical value
Requirements: L/D > 60, Re < 2300, developed flow
Acceptable Error: ±5% for Nu number
```

**Natural Convection (Vertical Plate):**
```
Analytical: Nu_L = 0.59·Ra_L^0.25 (laminar, uniform temperature)
Verification: Compare heat transfer coefficient
Requirements: 10⁴ < Ra_L < 10⁹, Pr > 0.6
Acceptable Error: ±10% for heat transfer coefficient
```

### Conservation Property Verification

**Global Energy Balance:**
```
Energy_in - Energy_out - Energy_stored = 0
Acceptable Imbalance: < 0.1% of dominant energy term
```

**Local Energy Conservation:**
```
∇·(ρcp·v·T) = ∇·(k∇T) + S_T
Verify at random interior points
Maximum Residual: < 1% of local source term
```

**Mass Conservation (for flow problems):**
```
∇·(ρv) = 0 (incompressible)
∂ρ/∂t + ∇·(ρv) = 0 (compressible)
Maximum Continuity Residual: < 0.01% of maximum flux
```

### Method of Manufactured Solutions

**Procedure:**
1. Assume analytical solution: T(x,y,t) = prescribed function
2. Substitute into governing equation to find source term
3. Apply assumed solution as boundary conditions
4. Run computational solver
5. Compare computed vs. assumed solution

**Example for 2D Heat Equation:**
```
Assumed: T(x,y,t) = sin(πx)·cos(πy)·exp(-2π²αt)
Source: S = -2π²α·sin(πx)·cos(πy)·exp(-2π²αt)
Expected: Order of accuracy verification
```

## Solution Verification Protocols

### Grid Convergence Studies

**Richardson Extrapolation Method:**

**Step 1: Generate Systematic Grid Sequence**
```
Grid refinement ratio: r = h_coarse/h_fine
Recommended: r = 2 (halving grid spacing)
Minimum grids: 3 levels (coarse, medium, fine)
```

**Step 2: Calculate Apparent Order of Accuracy**
```
p = ln|(f₃-f₂)/(f₂-f₁)|/ln(r)
where f₁, f₂, f₃ are solutions on fine, medium, coarse grids
```

**Step 3: Richardson Extrapolation**
```
f_exact ≈ f₁ + (f₁-f₂)/(r^p - 1)
```

**Step 4: Grid Convergence Index**
```
GCI = F_s·|ε₂₁|/(r^p - 1)
where ε₂₁ = (f₂-f₁)/f₁, F_s = safety factor (1.25-3.0)
```

**Grid Independence Criteria:**
- GCI < 5% for engineering applications
- GCI < 1% for research applications
- Asymptotic convergence range achieved

### Time Step Independence

**Temporal Convergence Study:**

**Systematic Time Step Reduction:**
```
Δt_sequence: Δt, Δt/2, Δt/4, Δt/8
Monitor: Maximum temperature, heat transfer rates
Criterion: Change < 1% between consecutive refinements
```

**CFL Number Monitoring:**
```
CFL = u·Δt/Δx (advection)
Fo = α·Δt/Δx² (diffusion)
Stability: CFL < 1, Fo < 0.5 (explicit schemes)
```

**Temporal Order Verification:**
```
Compare with analytical solutions for simple transient cases
Expected: 1st order (Euler), 2nd order (Crank-Nicolson)
```

### Iterative Convergence Monitoring

**Residual Tracking:**

**Energy Equation Residual:**
```
R_E = Σ|a_P·T_P - Σa_nb·T_nb - S_T|/Σ|a_P·T_P|
Target: R_E < 10⁻⁶ (typical), 10⁻⁸ (critical applications)
```

**Flow Equation Residuals:**
```
R_continuity = Σ|∇·(ρv)|/Σ|ρv|
R_momentum = Σ|momentum imbalance|/Σ|momentum flux|
Target: All residuals < 10⁻⁵
```

**Global Balance Monitoring:**
```
Heat_in - Heat_out - Heat_stored = Imbalance
Energy_imbalance/Dominant_term < 0.1%
```

### Sensitivity Analysis

**Parameter Sensitivity:**
```
S_i = (∂f/∂x_i)·(x_i/f)
