## Optimization Problem Formulation

### Multi-Objective Optimization Framework

**General Optimization Problem:**
```
Minimize: f(x) = [f₁(x), f₂(x), ..., fₙ(x)]
Subject to: gⱼ(x) ≤ 0, j = 1,2,...,m (inequality constraints)
           hₖ(x) = 0, k = 1,2,...,p (equality constraints)
           xᵢˡ ≤ xᵢ ≤ xᵢᵘ, i = 1,2,...,n (variable bounds)
```

**Thermal System Objective Functions:**

*Primary Objectives:*
- **Minimize maximum temperature**: f₁ = max(T(x,y,z))
- **Minimize thermal resistance**: f₂ = R_thermal = ΔT_max/P_total
- **Minimize total cost**: f₃ = C_material + C_manufacturing + C_operating
- **Minimize weight**: f₄ = Σ(ρᵢ × Vᵢ)
- **Minimize power consumption**: f₅ = P_fans + P_pumps + P_control

*Secondary Objectives:*
- **Maximize reliability**: f₆ = MTBF_thermal
- **Minimize noise**: f₇ = Sound_power_level
- **Minimize volume**: f₈ = Total_volume_occupied
- **Maximize efficiency**: f₉ = Heat_transferred/Power_consumed

### Constraint Classification

**Performance Constraints:**
```

```

**Physical Constraints:**
```
Volume_thermal ≤ Volume_available

## Single-Objective Optimization Methods

where Ra_L = g × β × ΔT × L³/(ν × α)
```

```
η_fin = tanh(mL)/(mL), where m = √(h×p/(k×A_c))
η_overall = 1 - (A_fin/A_total)×(1-η_fin)
```

- **Performance vs. Weight**: Better thermal performance often requires larger heat sinks
- **Performance vs. Noise**: Higher cooling capacity typically increases fan noise
- **Reliability vs. Cost**: Redundant systems improve reliability but increase cost

### Weighted Objective Method

```
f_combined = w₁×f₁_normalized + w₂×f₂_normalized + ... + wₙ×fₙ_normalized
where Σwᵢ = 1 and wᵢ ≥ 0
```

**Normalization Methods:**
- **Min-max normalization**: (f - f_min)/(f_max - f_min)
- **Target-based**: |f - f_target|/f_target
- **Preference-based**: Custom scaling based on engineering judgment

### Constraint-Based Optimization

**Sequential Optimization:**
1. **Primary objective**: Minimize maximum temperature
2. **Secondary optimization**: Among solutions meeting temperature constraint, minimize cost
3. **Tertiary optimization**: Among cost-optimal solutions, minimize weight

**Penalty Function Method:**
```
f_penalized = f_primary + Σ(penalty_i × max(0, constraint_violation_i)²)
```
