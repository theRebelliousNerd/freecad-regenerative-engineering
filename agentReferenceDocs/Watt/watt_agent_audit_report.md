   - Ensure cross-references between subdirectories function correctly
   - Validate practical examples align with Watt philosophy
   - Confirm engineering focus maintains throughout

## Audit Conclusion

The Watt Agent knowledge base audit revealed substantial progress with 15 of 25 required files (60%) either validated or newly created. The fundamentals, systems, and analysis subdirectories are now complete and provide excellent coverage of thermal engineering principles.

**Strengths:**
- Comprehensive theoretical foundation established
- Strong practical engineering focus maintained
- Excellent integration of Watt's systematic methodology
- Rigorous quality assurance frameworks developed

**Critical Gaps:**
- Materials knowledge base 80% incomplete (4 of 5 files missing)
- Integration knowledge base 80% incomplete (4 of 5 files missing)
- These gaps significantly limit multiphysics and materials selection capabilities

**Overall Assessment:** Substantial foundation established with critical specialized knowledge gaps requiring immediate attention. The completed sections provide excellent thermal engineering coverage, but the missing materials and integration files represent significant capability limitations for comprehensive thermal system design.

**Recommendation:** Prioritize completion of materials and integration subdirectories to achieve full Watt Agent thermal engineering capabilities as envisioned in the original framework design.
