**When Optimization Results Don't Manufacture:**
1. Trace manufacturing constraints through parametric model
2. Review optimization boundaries against production capabilities
3. Integrate manufacturing feedback into optimization parameters

### The FreeCAD Optimization Ecosystem

The integration creates a complete ecosystem where:

**Optimization Drives Geometry:**
- Mathematical optimization directly controls CAD parameters
- Geometry updates automatically as optimization converges
- Manufacturing constraints are integral to optimization process
- Design intent is preserved through parametric relationships

**CAD Informs Optimization:**
- Geometric analysis provides feedback to optimization algorithms
- Manufacturing constraints discovered in CAD update optimization boundaries
- Assembly issues identified in CAD trigger optimization parameter adjustments
- Real-world geometry testing validates optimization assumptions

**Knowledge Accumulates:**
- Successful optimization implementations become reusable templates
- Parameter relationships proven in FreeCAD inform future optimizations
- Manufacturing feedback improves optimization constraint databases
- Integration patterns become systematic methodologies

### The Khan-FreeCAD Philosophy

The integration embodies Khan's principle: **Create grammars of solutions, not isolated optimizations.**

Every FreeCAD optimization implementation:
- Becomes a reusable parametric template
- Documents successful optimization-to-CAD translation patterns
- Builds libraries of proven implementation approaches
- Creates validated workflows for similar future problems

The goal is not just to optimize and model, but to create **systematic bridges** between optimization mathematics and manufacturing reality, ensuring that theoretical optimization advantages translate reliably into practical engineering success.

Remember: The strongest optimization is worthless if it cannot be implemented. The FreeCAD integration cables ensure that Khan's systematic optimization methodology produces real, manufacturable, economically viable solutions.
