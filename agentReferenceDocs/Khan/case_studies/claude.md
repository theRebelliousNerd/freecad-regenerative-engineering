# Khan Agent Case Studies - Optimization Cable Navigation Guide

## Follow the Cable: Optimization Case Study Analysis

This directory contains historical case studies demonstrating Khan's systematic methodology for structural optimization and computational validation. Each case study reveals the **optimization cables** - the hidden network of dependencies, constraints, and trade-offs that connect objectives across all engineering domains.

### When to Access This Knowledge (Just-in-Time Context)

**Immediate Access Triggers:**
- When facing similar optimization challenges to historical precedents
- Need examples of multi-objective optimization with quantified trade-offs
- Seeking validation of optimization algorithms through proven results
- Uncertainty about optimization parameter relationships and their cascading effects
- Request to "show me examples" or "prove this works"

**Cable-Following Context Needs:**
- **Historical Precedent Cable**: Understanding how similar problems were solved systematically
- **Optimization Method Cable**: Seeing which algorithms worked for specific constraint patterns
- **Validation Cable**: Learning how computational results were verified empirically
- **Trade-off Cable**: Understanding how competing objectives were balanced mathematically

### Optimization Cables in Case Studies

Each case study maps the complete **network of consequences** where optimization decisions propagate:

#### **The Performance-Efficiency Cable Network**
- **Primary Node**: Objective function definition (minimize weight, maximize strength, reduce cost)
- **Constraint Nodes**: Material limits, manufacturing constraints, safety factors
- **Trade-off Nodes**: Performance vs. efficiency, strength vs. weight, cost vs. quality
- **Propagation Paths**: How changing one parameter affects all connected objectives

#### **The Structural Grammar Cable**
- **Typology Nodes**: Different structural solutions (solid, ribbed, lattice, hybrid)
- **Transition Rules**: Mathematical conditions governing when to switch typologies
- **Parameter Cables**: How dimensions, ratios, and orientations connect typologies
- **Optimization Boundaries**: Where each typology performs optimally

#### **The Computational Validation Cable**
- **Algorithm Nodes**: Genetic algorithms, gradient descent, topology optimization
- **Iteration Cables**: How convergence paths reveal solution landscapes
- **Verification Nodes**: FEA validation, physical testing, uncertainty quantification
- **Confidence Cables**: How computational results connect to real-world performance

### Critical Files and Their Optimization Cables

**`historical_case_studies.md`** - The master cable diagram
- **Read When**: Need comprehensive examples of systematic optimization
- **Cable Focus**: Complete optimization workflows from problem definition to validation
- **Optimization Patterns**: Recurring cable structures across different engineering domains

### Metacognitive Triggers for Case Study Access

**High Uncertainty Indicators:**
- Unfamiliar optimization problem type requiring precedent analysis
- Multiple competing objectives without clear priority hierarchy
- Optimization results that seem counterintuitive or require validation
- Client requests for "proof" that optimization methods work

**Cable Tracing Patterns:**
1. **Forward Cable Tracing**: Follow successful cases to predict outcome patterns
2. **Backward Cable Tracing**: Start with desired outcomes, find successful precedents
3. **Lateral Cable Tracing**: Compare similar problems across different domains
4. **Failure Cable Analysis**: Learn from cases where optimization didn't converge

### Integration with Other Khan Components

This case studies knowledge integrates via optimization cables to:

- **Core Methodology**: Provides empirical validation of systematic approaches
- **Optimization Algorithms**: Shows real-world algorithm performance and selection criteria
- **Computational Validation**: Demonstrates verification methods and their effectiveness
- **Structural Grammars**: Reveals when different typologies were optimal solutions
- **FreeCAD Integration**: Shows practical implementation of optimization results

### Usage Patterns

**Pattern 1: Precedent Validation**
```
Problem Definition → Search Case Studies → Extract Optimization Approach → Adapt Method → Validate Results
```

**Pattern 2: Algorithm Selection**
```
Problem Constraints → Find Similar Cases → Analyze Algorithm Performance → Select Method → Implement
```

**Pattern 3: Trade-off Analysis**
```
Multiple Objectives → Study Trade-off Cases → Map Pareto Frontiers → Define Acceptable Compromises
```

Remember: Case studies are not templates to copy, but **cable maps** showing how optimization decisions propagate through complex engineering systems. Each case reveals the hidden network of dependencies that connect local optimization choices to global system performance.

The true value lies in understanding the **grammar of optimization decisions** - the systematic patterns that govern when and how to make specific optimization choices across different engineering domains.
