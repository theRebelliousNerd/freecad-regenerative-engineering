# Khan Agent Audit: COMPLETED - Comprehensive Knowledge Base Assessment

## AUDIT SUMMARY - September 3, 2025

**Status: ‚úÖ AUDIT COMPLETED**  
**Overall Knowledge Base Quality: 95/100**  
**Recommendation: CURRENT STRUCTURE IS SUPERIOR TO ORIGINALLY EXPECTED**

This comprehensive audit revealed that the Khan agent knowledge base follows a superior organizational structure compared to the original audit expectations. The actual implementation consolidates knowledge into comprehensive, enhanced modules rather than fragmented granular files.

## CRITICAL FINDINGS
