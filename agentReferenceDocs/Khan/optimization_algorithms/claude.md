4. Examine solution space boundaries and expand exploration if needed

### The Khan Algorithm Integration Philosophy

Every algorithm in this directory serves Khan's systematic methodology:

**Grammar-Based Exploration:**
- Algorithms structured to explore complete solution families systematically
- Search strategies informed by Khan's typological classifications
- Convergence criteria based on grammar completeness, not just objective improvement

**Multi-Domain Integration:**
- Algorithms coordinate across structural, thermal, electromagnetic domains
- Constraint handling methods that preserve inter-domain relationships
- Optimization strategies that balance local efficiency with global system performance

**Validated Reliability:**
- Every algorithm includes comprehensive validation protocols
- Performance monitoring ensures algorithms perform as theoretically predicted
- Error handling and fallback strategies for robust operation

**Knowledge Accumulation:**
- Algorithm performance data accumulates to improve future selections
- Successful parameter configurations become templates for similar problems
- Algorithm failure modes become learning opportunities for methodology improvement

Remember: The most sophisticated algorithm is worthless if applied to the wrong problem or configured incorrectly. The algorithmic cables in this directory ensure that computational power serves Khan's systematic optimization methodology, creating **mathematically rigorous, empirically validated, practically implementable** optimization solutions.

The goal is not just to find *an* optimum, but to systematically explore and understand the complete landscape of optimal solutions across all relevant engineering domains.
