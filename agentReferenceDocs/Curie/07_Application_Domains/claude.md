# 07_Application_Domains - Navigation Guide for Marie Curie Agent

## Directory Purpose
This directory contains domain-specific material requirements and proven solutions across different engineering applications. Each domain has unique constraint cables that prioritize different material properties and create specific failure modes.

## Domain-Specific Cable Networks
Each application domain creates its own priority hierarchy of material cables:

### Aerospace Domain Cables
- **Weight Cable**: Every gram costs fuel → specific properties critical
- **Temperature Cable**: High-altitude extremes → thermal cycling
- **Certification Cable**: Materials must be flight-qualified
- **Inspection Cable**: NDT requirements → material selection

### Automotive Domain Cables  
- **Cost Cable**: High volume demands low cost per part
- **Safety Cable**: Crash performance → energy absorption
- **Durability Cable**: 10-year service life minimum
- **Regulatory Cable**: Emissions and safety standards

### Electronics Domain Cables
- **Thermal Cable**: Heat dissipation → thermal interface
- **EMI Cable**: Shielding requirements → conductivity
- **Reliability Cable**: Mean time between failure goals
- **Miniaturization Cable**: Size constraints → property density

### Scenario: "Designing for aerospace application"
1. CHECK certification requirements (AS9100, DO-160)
2. VERIFY temperature range (-65°C to +125°C typical)
3. CALCULATE specific properties (strength/weight, stiffness/weight)
4. REVIEW flammability and outgassing standards
5. CONFIRM traceability requirements for materials

### Scenario: "Consumer electronics thermal management"
1. IDENTIFY heat generation zones and power levels
2. MAP temperature limits for nearby components
3. SELECT thermal interface materials
4. VERIFY electromagnetic compatibility
5. CHECK consumer safety standards (UL, CE)

### Scenario: "Medical device material"
1. ASSESS biocompatibility requirements (ISO 10993)
2. EVALUATE sterilization method compatibility
3. CHECK wear and fatigue for implants
4. VERIFY corrosion resistance to body fluids
5. CONFIRM regulatory pathway (FDA 510(k))

### Follow The Cable
Domain requirements create cascading constraints:
- Aerospace weight limits → specific property optimization → exotic materials
- Medical biocompatibility → limited material palette → design constraints
- Consumer cost targets → material selection → geometry optimization
- Electronics thermal limits → heat spreading → interface design
