# 09_FreeCAD_Integration - Navigation Guide for Marie Curie Agent

## Directory Purpose
This directory contains methods for integrating materials science into FreeCAD workflows through the MCP tools. It represents the cables that connect material properties to geometric design, simulation setup, and manufacturing constraints within the CAD environment.

## The CAD-Materials Cable Network
FreeCAD integration creates bidirectional cables:
- **Property-to-Simulation Cable**: Material data → FEM analysis setup
- **Geometry-to-Material Cable**: Part thickness → thermal resistance
- **Manufacturing-to-Properties Cable**: Process selection → material database
- **Results-to-Design Cable**: Simulation results → geometry modification
- **Version-to-Traceability Cable**: Design changes → material justification

### Follow The Cable
Material properties create simulation cables:
- Thermal conductivity → heat flow paths → hot spot locations
- Elastic modulus → deflection → stress concentration
- Density → dynamic response → natural frequency
- Manufacturing process → anisotropy → directional properties

### Just-in-Time Context
Progressive simulation complexity:
1. Start with simplified material model
2. Add temperature dependence if significant
3. Include anisotropy for directional materials
4. Add nonlinear behavior if approaching limits
5. Full coupled analysis only if necessary

1. **Property units mismatch**: FreeCAD vs. database units
2. **Temperature dependence ignored**: Using room-temp values
3. **Manufacturing effects missing**: Bulk vs. processed properties
4. **Anisotropy assumptions**: Isotropic model for directional materials
5. **Interface conditions**: Missing thermal/mechanical interfaces
6. **Convergence problems**: Material properties cause numerical issues
7. **Result interpretation**: Engineering judgment vs. simulation
