# 05_Manufacturing_Integration - Navigation Guide for Marie Curie Agent

## Directory Purpose
This directory reveals how manufacturing processes fundamentally alter material properties. The "as-designed" and "as-built" materials are different entities connected by the manufacturing cable. Every process leaves its signature in the final properties.

## The Manufacturing Transformation Cable
Manufacturing is not just shaping - it's material transformation:
- **Thermal History Cable**: Cooling rates → crystallinity → properties
- **Mechanical Working Cable**: Deformation → grain structure → strength
- **Chemical Process Cable**: Surface treatments → corrosion resistance
- **Assembly Method Cable**: Joining technique → interface strength
- **Orientation Cable**: Build direction → anisotropy (especially 3D printing)

### Scenario: "3D printed PETG part"
1. START with bulk PETG properties
2. APPLY layer adhesion factor (0.6-0.8× tensile strength)
3. CONSIDER build orientation effects:
   - Z-direction weakest (across layers)
   - XY-direction strongest (along layers)
4. ACCOUNT for process parameters:
   - Higher temp → better adhesion
   - Slower speed → better fusion
5. VERIFY with Gabe for specific printer

### Scenario: "Injection molded enclosure"
1. RETRIEVE base polymer properties
2. MODIFY for process effects:
   - Molecular orientation near gates
   - Residual stress from cooling
   - Weld lines at flow fronts (70% strength)
3. CONSIDER glass fiber effects if filled:
   - Orientation along flow
   - Higher stiffness parallel to flow
4. CHECK for warpage from differential shrinkage

### Scenario: "CNC machined aluminum"
1. START with alloy temper condition
2. CONSIDER cutting effects:
   - Surface work hardening
   - Residual stress from cutting forces
   - Potential for stress corrosion
3. ACCOUNT for heat treatment if required:
   - Solution treatment → quench → age
   - Property changes at each step
4. VERIFY dimensional stability over time

### Process-Property Uncertainty Flags
- **"As-printed"**: Properties vary with every parameter
- **"Post-processed"**: Additional transformations applied
- **"Multi-material"**: Interface properties unknown
- **"Prototype vs. production"**: Different processes = different properties
- **"Scaled up"**: Size effects can change properties

### Critical Process Parameters

#### 3D Printing (FDM/FFF)
- **Nozzle temperature**: Fusion quality
- **Bed temperature**: Warpage and adhesion
- **Layer height**: Surface finish and strength
- **Print speed**: Layer bonding time
- **Infill pattern/density**: Mechanical properties

#### Injection Molding
- **Melt temperature**: Degradation risk
- **Injection pressure**: Molecular orientation
- **Cooling rate**: Crystallinity and shrinkage
- **Mold temperature**: Surface finish
- **Gate location**: Flow patterns and weld lines

## Process-Induced Property Changes

### Strength Modifications
```
Original Material Strength
├─ Reduced by:
│   ├─ Weld/knit lines (-30%)
│   ├─ Layer interfaces (-40%)
│   ├─ Porosity/voids (-varies)
│   └─ Thermal degradation (-20%)
└─ Increased by:
    ├─ Work hardening (+20%)
    ├─ Favorable orientation (+50%)
    └─ Optimal heat treatment (+100%)
```

### Dimensional Considerations
- **Shrinkage**: 0.5-2% for plastics, plan accordingly
- **Warpage**: Differential cooling causes distortion
- **Tolerance stack-up**: Each process has limits
- **Surface finish**: Ra values process-dependent
- **Feature resolution**: Minimum sizes vary by method

### Upstream (Manufacturing Depends On)
- Material selection (processability)
- Design geometry (manufacturability)
- Production volume (process choice)
- Cost constraints (method selection)
- Quality requirements (process capability)

### Downstream (Manufacturing Affects)
- Final properties (never same as datasheet)
- Assembly methods (surface conditions)
- Inspection requirements (critical features)
- Post-processing needs (support removal, finishing)
- Quality control (process validation)

### Follow The Cable
Manufacturing creates property cables:
- Print orientation → weakness direction → load path design
- Cooling rate → residual stress → distortion → assembly issues
- Surface finish → friction → wear rate → maintenance schedule
- Process variation → property spread → safety factor required

### Just-in-Time Context
Retrieve process data progressively:
1. General process capabilities first
2. Specific parameter effects when needed
3. Detailed defect modes for critical features
4. Statistical variation for tolerance analysis
5. Aging/degradation only for long-term use
