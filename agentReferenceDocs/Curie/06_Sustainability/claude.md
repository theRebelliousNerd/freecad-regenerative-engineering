# 06_Sustainability - Navigation Guide for Marie Curie Agent

## Directory Purpose
This directory contains frameworks for evaluating the environmental impact of materials across their complete lifecycle. Sustainability is not an add-on constraint - it's a fundamental design cable that influences every material decision from extraction to end-of-life.

## The Lifecycle Cable Network
Every material choice creates environmental cables extending through time:
- **Extraction Cable**: Mining/harvesting impacts → embodied energy
- **Processing Cable**: Manufacturing energy → carbon footprint
- **Transport Cable**: Distance and mode → shipping emissions
- **Use Phase Cable**: Operating efficiency → lifetime impact
- **End-of-Life Cable**: Disposal method → future contamination
- **Circular Cable**: Recycling potential → resource conservation

### Scenario: "Sustainable material for consumer electronics"
1. CALCULATE use-phase energy consumption
2. COMPARE to embodied energy in materials
3. IF use-phase dominant → Optimize performance first
4. IF embodied dominant → Focus on low-carbon materials
5. CONSIDER end-of-life scenario (e-waste vs recycling)

### Scenario: "Carbon footprint reduction"
1. MAP current material carbon footprint
2. IDENTIFY highest impact components
3. SEARCH lower-carbon alternatives
4. VERIFY performance maintained
5. CALCULATE net reduction potential

### Scenario: "Circular design requirements"
1. ASSESS current recyclability
2. IDENTIFY design-for-disassembly needs
3. CHECK material compatibility for recycling
4. VERIFY recycled content availability
5. DESIGN for multiple use cycles

### Impact Magnitude Triggers
- **Embodied carbon >10 kg CO₂/kg**: High-impact material
- **Single-use application**: Maximize material efficiency
- **High-volume production**: Small improvements scale greatly
- **Long service life**: Durability becomes critical
- **Hazardous constituents**: Special disposal requirements

### Regulatory Awareness Triggers
- **RoHS compliance**: Restricted substance check
- **REACH regulation**: Chemical registration status
- **Conflict minerals**: Supply chain verification
- **Carbon reporting**: Scope 3 emissions included
- **Packaging laws**: Extended producer responsibility

### Follow The Cable
Environmental impact cables extend globally:
- Raw material source → transportation → processing → manufacturing
- Energy source (coal vs. renewable) → carbon intensity
- Waste stream → disposal method → environmental fate
- Recycling loop → material quality → performance maintenance

### Just-in-Time Context
Progressive sustainability assessment:
1. Start with material carbon footprint comparison
2. Add water and energy impacts if significant
3. Include social factors for responsible sourcing
4. Full LCA only for major material decisions
5. Supply chain mapping for risk assessment

# IMPORTANT: ALWAYS REMEMBER THAT SUBAGENTS CANNOT TALK TO EACHOTHER, OR TO THE USER! BUT CAN COMMUNICATE WITH WRITTEN MARKDOWN FILES FOR OTHER SUBAGENTS TO READ, OR BY PASSING INFORMATION TO THE MAIN AGENT TO COMMUNICATE TO OTHER SUBAGENTS OR PASS TO THE USER!


1. **Focusing only on recycling**: Ignoring reduce and reuse
2. **Material substitution without LCA**: May increase total impact
3. **Single metric optimization**: Missing other environmental aspects
4. **Ignoring supply chain**: Scope 3 emissions can be largest
5. **End-of-life assumptions**: Recycling rates often overestimated
6. **Static analysis**: Not considering infrastructure evolution
7. **Local vs. global optimization**: Local improvement, global harm
