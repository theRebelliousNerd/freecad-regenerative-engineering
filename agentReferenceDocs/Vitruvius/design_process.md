# Human-Centered Design Process

## The Vitruvian Design Philosophy
True human-centered design is not a methodology—it is a way of thinking that places the human experience at the center of every design decision. It recognizes that firmitas (strength), utilitas (function), and venustas (beauty) must all serve human needs, not abstract ideals.

## Foundational Principles

### The Human as the Measure
- **Anthropocentric Design**: All decisions referenced to human capabilities and limitations
- **Diversity First**: Design for the full spectrum of human diversity, not mythical averages
- **Context Sensitivity**: Consider the complete context of human use
- **Lifecycle Thinking**: Account for all phases of human interaction

### Design for Extremes
- **Edge Case Priority**: Design for the most challenging scenarios first
- **Inclusive by Default**: Universal accessibility rather than special accommodation
- **Fail-Safe Orientation**: When systems fail, they fail safely for humans
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Base functionality accessible to all, enhanced for some

## The Human-Centered Design Process

### Phase 1: Understand and Specify Context of Use

#### User Research Methods:
1. **Contextual Inquiry**
   - Observe users in their natural environment
   - Understand workflows, interruptions, and adaptations
   - Document physical, cognitive, and social contexts
   - Identify unmet needs and pain points

2. **Stakeholder Analysis**
   - Primary users (direct interaction)
   - Secondary users (affected by use)
   - Tertiary users (maintenance, support)
   - Non-users (those who might be excluded)

3. **Task Analysis**
   - Hierarchical breakdown of user goals
   - Sequential flow of actions
   - Decision points and error opportunities
   - Cognitive and physical demands

4. **Environmental Analysis**
   - Physical conditions (lighting, noise, space)
   - Social context (privacy, collaboration)
   - Technical infrastructure (connectivity, power)
   - Regulatory and cultural constraints

#### User Characterization:

##### Anthropometric Profiling:
- **Body Dimensions**: 5th, 50th, 95th percentile data for target population
- **Strength Capabilities**: Force limits for sustained and peak performance
- **Range of Motion**: Joint flexibility and postural constraints
- **Sensory Abilities**: Vision, hearing, tactile, and cognitive capabilities

##### Skill and Experience Levels:
- **Novice Users**: Limited domain knowledge, sequential processing
- **Intermediate Users**: Some experience, developing mental models
- **Expert Users**: Extensive knowledge, pattern recognition, shortcuts
- **Returning Users**: Occasional use, may forget procedures

##### Accessibility Considerations:
- **Temporary Disabilities**: Injury, carrying items, environmental constraints
- **Permanent Disabilities**: Vision, hearing, mobility, cognitive impairments
- **Age-Related Changes**: Declining strength, vision, hearing, cognition
- **Cultural and Linguistic Diversity**: Different backgrounds and languages

### Phase 2: Specify User and Organizational Requirements

#### Functional Requirements:
- **Primary Tasks**: Core functionality that must be supported
- **Secondary Tasks**: Important but not critical functionality
- **Emergency Tasks**: Safety-critical operations and error recovery
- **Maintenance Tasks**: Upkeep, configuration, and administration

#### Performance Requirements:

Remember: Human-centered design is not about following a checklist—it is about developing deep empathy for users and relentlessly advocating for their needs throughout the design process. Every design decision should be filtered through the question: "How does this serve the humans who will interact with this product?" When in doubt, ask the users. When they cannot tell you, observe them. When you cannot observe them, err on the side of human safety and capability.
