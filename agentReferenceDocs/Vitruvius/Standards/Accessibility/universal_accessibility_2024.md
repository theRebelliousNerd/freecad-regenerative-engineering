# Universal Accessibility Guidelines (2024-2025)

*"Good design enables, poor design disables"* - Vitruvius' Universal Design Principle

## Core Philosophy: Inclusive by Design
True accessibility means designing from the beginning for the full spectrum of human diversity - not retrofitting accommodations as an afterthought. Every design decision should consider users with permanent, temporary, and situational disabilities.

## Seven Principles of Universal Design

### 1. Equitable Use
**Principle**: The design is useful and marketable to people with diverse abilities.
**Guidelines**:
- Provide the same means of use for all users: identical whenever possible, equivalent when not
- Avoid segregating or stigmatizing any users
- Provisions for privacy, security, and safety should be equally available to all users
- Make the design appealing to all users

**FreeCAD Application**:
- Controls accessible by both hands and feet
- Visual and tactile feedback for all functions
- No functions requiring color discrimination alone
- Consistent interaction methods across all features

### 2. Flexibility in Use
**Principle**: The design accommodates a wide range of individual preferences and abilities.
**Guidelines**:
- Provide choice in methods of use
- Accommodate right- or left-handed access and use
- Facilitate the user's accuracy and precision
- Provide adaptability to the user's pace

**FreeCAD Application**:
- Multiple ways to access every function (toolbar, menu, keyboard)
- Configurable interface layouts
- Adjustable timing for automatic functions
- Support for various input devices

### 3. Simple and Intuitive Use
**Principle**: Use of the design is easy to understand, regardless of experience, language skills, or current concentration level.
**Guidelines**:
- Eliminate unnecessary complexity
- Be consistent with user expectations and intuition
- Accommodate a wide range of literacy and language skills
- Arrange information in order of importance
- Provide effective prompting and feedback during and after task completion

### 4. Perceptible Information
**Principle**: The design communicates necessary information effectively to the user, regardless of ambient conditions or sensory abilities.
**Guidelines**:
- Use different modes (pictorial, verbal, tactile) for redundant presentation
- Provide adequate contrast between essential information and surroundings
- Maximize "legibility" of essential information
- Differentiate elements in ways that can be described (instructions/directions)
- Provide compatibility with assistive technologies

### 5. Tolerance for Error
**Principle**: The design minimizes hazards and adverse consequences of accidental or unintended actions.
**Guidelines**:
- Arrange elements to minimize hazards and errors
- Provide warnings of hazards and errors
- Provide fail safe features
- Discourage unconscious action in tasks requiring vigilance

### 6. Low Physical Effort
**Principle**: The design can be used efficiently and comfortably with a minimum of fatigue.
**Guidelines**:
- Allow user to maintain a neutral body position
- Use reasonable operating forces
- Minimize repetitive actions
- Minimize sustained physical effort

### 7. Size and Space for Approach and Use
**Principle**: Appropriate size and space is provided for approach, reach, manipulation, and use regardless of user's body size, posture, or mobility.
**Guidelines**:
- Provide a clear line of sight to important elements for any seated or standing user
- Make reach to all components comfortable for any seated or standing user
- Accommodate variations in hand and grip size
- Provide adequate space for the use of assistive devices or personal assistance

**ACCESSIBILITY COMMITMENT**: Accessibility is not a feature to be added later but a fundamental design principle that must be integrated from the beginning. Every design decision should ask: "Does this enable or disable users?" When in doubt, choose the option that provides the greatest access to the greatest number of people, especially those who are traditionally excluded from design consideration.
