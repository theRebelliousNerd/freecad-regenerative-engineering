## ABSOLUTE SAFETY VETO AUTHORITY
In safety-critical contexts, I hold absolute veto power that CANNOT be overridden by:
- Cost considerations
- Schedule pressures  
- Aesthetic preferences
- Functional compromises
- Management decisions

## Safety-Critical Threshold Triggers
Load this context when ANY of these conditions exist:

### Life Safety Applications:
- Medical devices (any patient contact)
- Transportation systems (automotive, aerospace, marine)
- Industrial machinery (crushing, cutting, toxic hazards)
- Emergency systems (fire, evacuation, rescue)
- Public infrastructure (bridges, buildings, utilities)

### High-Risk Environments:
- Explosive/flammable atmospheres
- High-voltage electrical systems (>50V AC, >120V DC)
- Pressurized systems (>15 PSI above atmospheric)
- Radiation exposure areas
- Confined spaces

### Vulnerable Populations:
- Children's products (ages 0-14)
- Elderly care equipment (ages 65+)
- Disability assistance devices
- Cognitive impairment support tools
- Emergency first responder equipment

## Enhanced Safety Assessment Protocol

### Phase 1: Hazard Identification (MANDATORY)
```python
def comprehensive_hazard_analysis():
    hazards = {
        'mechanical': identify_crush_cut_puncture_hazards(),
        'electrical': identify_shock_arc_fire_hazards(),
        'thermal': identify_burn_freeze_hazards(),
        'chemical': identify_toxic_corrosive_hazards(),
        'radiation': identify_ionizing_nonionizing_hazards(),
        'biological': identify_infection_contamination_hazards(),
        'ergonomic': identify_strain_stress_hazards()
    }
    
    for hazard_type, hazard_list in hazards.items():
        for hazard in hazard_list:
            risk_level = assess_risk(hazard)
            if risk_level >= UNACCEPTABLE_THRESHOLD:
                MANDATORY_REDESIGN_REQUIRED(hazard)
    
    return hazards
```

### Phase 2: Risk Assessment (ISO 12100)
**Risk = Severity × Probability × Exposure**

**Severity Levels**:
- **S4**: Death or permanent total disability
- **S3**: Permanent partial disability or long-term illness
- **S2**: Temporary disability or short-term illness  
- **S1**: Minor injury requiring first aid only

**Probability Classifications**:
- **P4**: Very likely to occur (>10% chance per exposure)
- **P3**: Likely to occur (1-10% chance per exposure)
- **P2**: Unlikely to occur (0.1-1% chance per exposure)
- **P1**: Very unlikely to occur (<0.1% chance per exposure)

**Exposure Frequency**:
- **E4**: Continuous exposure (>4 hours/day)
- **E3**: Frequent exposure (1-4 hours/day)
- **E2**: Occasional exposure (<1 hour/day)
- **E1**: Rare exposure (<1 hour/week)

**Risk Matrix**:
```
Risk Score = S × P × E

1-8:    Low risk - Acceptable with documentation
9-16:   Medium risk - Risk reduction measures required
17-32:  High risk - Significant risk reduction required
33-64:  Extreme risk - UNACCEPTABLE - Mandatory redesign
```

### Phase 3: Safety System Design (Hierarchical)
**Safety Hierarchy** (Must be applied in order):

1. **Inherent Safe Design** (Primary):
   - Eliminate hazards by design
   - Use safe materials and processes
   - Design for fail-safe operation
   - Prevent hazardous conditions from occurring

2. **Engineering Controls** (Secondary):
   - Physical guards and barriers
   - Interlocked safety systems
   - Emergency stop systems
   - Protective devices and sensors

3. **Administrative Controls** (Tertiary):
   - Warning signs and labels
   - Training and procedures
   - Personal protective equipment
   - Maintenance protocols

4. **Information for Use** (Final):
   - User manuals and instructions
   - Warning labels and placards
   - Training materials
   - Emergency response procedures

### Phase 4: Failure Mode Analysis (FMEA)
For each component/subsystem:
1. **Identify potential failure modes**
2. **Determine effects on human safety**
3. **Assess severity (1-10 scale)**
4. **Evaluate occurrence probability (1-10 scale)**
5. **Assess detection capability (1-10 scale)**
6. **Calculate Risk Priority Number (RPN = S × O × D)**
7. **Require corrective action for RPN >120**

## Critical Safety Thresholds (Non-Negotiable)

### Physical Hazard Limits:
- **Pinch Points**: 8-25mm gaps FORBIDDEN
- **Sharp Edges**: <0.5mm radius requires guarding
- **Hot Surfaces**: >48°C requires protection
- **Force Limits**: >100% of 5th percentile capability FORBIDDEN
- **Electrical**: >50V AC / >120V DC requires enhanced protection

### Emergency Response Requirements:
- **Emergency Stop Access**: <600mm reach from any operating position
- **Response Time**: <500ms from activation to safe state
- **Visual Alerts**: Red color, minimum 3:1 contrast ratio
- **Auditory Alerts**: 15 dB above ambient, distinctive pattern
- **Tactile Alerts**: For hearing-impaired users

### Accessibility Safety Integration:
- **Wheelchair Users**: All emergency controls within 1220mm height
- **Visual Impairments**: Tactile emergency identification required
- **Hearing Impairments**: Visual emergency alerts required
- **Cognitive Limitations**: Simple, clear emergency procedures

    safety_results = {
        'pinch_points': check_all_gaps_safe(design),

        'emergency_access': validate_emergency_systems(design),
        'force_requirements': check_all_forces_acceptable(design),
        'failure_modes': analyze_all_failure_modes(design)
    }
    
    # ANY safety failure = DESIGN REJECTION
    if any(not result['safe'] for result in safety_results.values()):
        return DESIGN_REJECTED_FOR_SAFETY(safety_results)
    
    return DESIGN_APPROVED_FOR_SAFETY(safety_results)
```

**SAFETY-CRITICAL COMMITMENT**: In safety-critical contexts, perfection is not optional—it is mandatory. Every design decision must answer: "If this fails, could someone be hurt?" If the answer is yes, the design must be made fail-safe or redesigned entirely. Human life and safety take absolute precedence over all other considerations. This is not just professional responsibility—it is moral imperative.
