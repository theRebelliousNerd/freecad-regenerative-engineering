# Cognitive Factors in Human-Centered Design

## The Mind as Design Medium
The human cognitive system is not a computer—it is a biological information processing system with inherent limitations, biases, and adaptive capabilities. Understanding these characteristics is essential for creating designs that work with, rather than against, human mental architecture.

## Cognitive Architecture

### Information Processing Model
The human cognitive system operates through distinct but interconnected stages:

#### Sensory Memory (0.25-2 seconds)
- **Capacity**: Virtually unlimited but rapidly decaying
- **Function**: Initial sensory impressions, automatic filtering
- **Design Implication**: Critical information must be prominent enough to pass sensory threshold

#### Short-Term (Working) Memory (15-30 seconds)
- **Capacity**: 7±2 items (Miller's Law)
- **Modern Research**: 4±1 chunks of meaningful information  
- **Function**: Conscious processing and manipulation
- **Design Implication**: Interfaces should present ≤7 distinct elements simultaneously

#### Long-Term Memory (Permanent)
- **Capacity**: Effectively unlimited
- **Types**: Procedural (how-to), declarative (facts), episodic (experiences)
- **Function**: Storage of learned patterns, procedures, and knowledge
- **Design Implication**: Leverage existing mental models and patterns

### Attention Systems

#### Selective Attention
- **Function**: Focus on relevant information while filtering distractions
- **Limitations**: Can only focus on one complex task at a time
- **Design Strategy**: Minimize competing elements during critical tasks

#### Divided Attention
- **Function**: Monitor multiple information streams simultaneously
- **Limitations**: Performance degrades rapidly with additional tasks
- **Design Strategy**: Reduce cognitive load during multitasking scenarios

#### Sustained Attention (Vigilance)
- **Function**: Maintain focus over extended periods
- **Limitations**: Attention decreases over time, especially for monitoring tasks
- **Design Strategy**: Provide periodic engagement and feedback

## Cognitive Load Theory

### Types of Cognitive Load

#### Intrinsic Load
- **Definition**: Mental effort required by task complexity itself
- **Characteristics**: Cannot be eliminated, inherent to the task
- **Design Approach**: Optimize task flow and information presentation
- **Measurement**: Task complexity × Element interactivity

#### Extraneous Load
- **Definition**: Mental effort imposed by poor design or presentation
- **Characteristics**: Wastes cognitive resources, impedes learning/performance
- **Design Approach**: Eliminate unnecessary complexity
- **Common Sources**: Unclear navigation, visual clutter, poor organization

#### Germane Load
- **Definition**: Mental effort devoted to processing, construction, and automation of schemas
- **Characteristics**: Beneficial for learning and skill development
- **Design Approach**: Support pattern recognition and skill building
- **Goal**: Maximize germane load when extraneous load is minimized

### Cognitive Load Assessment

#### Subjective Measures:
- **NASA Task Load Index (TLX)**: Multi-dimensional assessment
  - Mental Demand
  - Physical Demand  
  - Temporal Demand
  - Performance
  - Effort
  - Frustration Level

#### Objective Measures:
- **Task Performance**: Accuracy, speed, error rates
- **Physiological**: Heart rate variability, eye tracking, EEG
- **Behavioral**: Response times, mouse movements, interaction patterns

## Mental Models and Schema

### Mental Model Formation
Users create internal representations of how systems work based on:
- **Prior Experience**: Similar systems and interfaces
- **Cultural Knowledge**: Shared understanding and conventions
- **Physical Metaphors**: Real-world analogies (folders, desktop, trash)
- **System Feedback**: Responses to user actions

### Design Implications:
- **Consistency**: Match user expectations from similar systems
- **Metaphors**: Use appropriate and culturally relevant analogies
- **Feedback**: Provide clear indication of system state and changes
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Reveal complexity gradually as users develop understanding

### Schema Development:
- **Novice Users**: Rule-based behavior, sequential processing
- **Expert Users**: Pattern recognition, parallel processing
- **Design Strategy**: Support both novice and expert mental models

## Decision Making and Problem Solving

### Dual-Process Theory

#### System 1 (Fast Thinking):
- **Characteristics**: Automatic, intuitive, effortless
- **Strengths**: Quick pattern recognition, emotional evaluation
- **Weaknesses**: Prone to biases and heuristic errors
- **Design Support**: Clear visual hierarchy, familiar patterns, immediate feedback

#### System 2 (Slow Thinking):
- **Characteristics**: Deliberate, analytical, effortful
- **Strengths**: Logical reasoning, complex analysis
- **Weaknesses**: Limited capacity, easily fatigued
- **Design Support**: Reduce cognitive load, provide decision aids, allow time

### Cognitive Biases in Design

#### Confirmation Bias:
- **Effect**: Users seek information confirming existing beliefs
- **Design Response**: Present balanced information, highlight disconfirming evidence

#### Availability Heuristic:
- **Effect**: Overestimate probability of easily recalled events
- **Design Response**: Provide accurate probability information, avoid sensational examples

#### Anchoring Bias:
- **Effect**: Over-rely on first piece of information encountered
- **Design Response**: Present critical information prominently, avoid misleading anchors

#### Choice Overload:
- **Effect**: Too many options decrease decision quality and satisfaction
- **Design Response**: Limit choices, provide smart defaults, use progressive disclosure

## Error Types and Prevention

### Skill-Based Errors (Slips and Lapses)
- **Cause**: Automatic behavior in familiar situations
- **Examples**: Mistyping, clicking wrong button, forgetting step in routine
- **Prevention**: 
  - Clear visual feedback
  - Confirmation for critical actions
  - Consistent placement of controls
  - Undo functionality

### Rule-Based Errors
- **Cause**: Misapplication of learned rules or procedures
- **Examples**: Using wrong procedure for situation, following outdated rule
- **Prevention**:
  - Clear context indicators
  - Situation-appropriate guidance
  - Regular procedure updates
  - Context-sensitive help

### Knowledge-Based Errors
- **Cause**: Inadequate knowledge for problem-solving situation
- **Examples**: Incorrect diagnosis, poor strategy selection
