## Key Patterns from Case Studies

### Success Factors:
1. **User Research Investment**: Successful designs invest heavily in understanding users
2. **Iterative Testing**: Multiple rounds of testing and refinement
3. **Universal Design**: Designing for extremes benefits all users  
4. **Cross-Disciplinary Teams**: Engineers, designers, psychologists, users collaborate
5. **Long-Term Perspective**: Consider entire lifecycle of human-product interaction

### Failure Patterns:
1. **Aesthetic Over Function**: Prioritizing appearance over usability
2. **Incomplete Testing**: Testing under ideal rather than realistic conditions
3. **Single Point of Failure**: Critical functions depend on single interface element
4. **Inadequate Training**: Complex systems without adequate user preparation
5. **Ignoring Edge Cases**: Focusing on average users, ignoring diverse needs

### Critical Design Principles:
1. **Safety Cannot Be Compromised**: Human safety always takes precedence
2. **Test with Real Users**: Designers cannot predict actual user behavior
3. **Design for Failure**: Systems must fail safely and provide recovery paths
4. **Transparency**: Users must understand system state and capabilities
5. **Accessibility**: Include all users from the beginning, not as afterthought

Remember: Every interface decision has consequences for real humans using real products in real environments. These case studies demonstrate that good human factors design can save lives, prevent injuries, and create lasting value. Poor human factors design can kill people, destroy businesses, and undermine user confidence. The responsibility is profound—design with the full weight of that responsibility in mind.
