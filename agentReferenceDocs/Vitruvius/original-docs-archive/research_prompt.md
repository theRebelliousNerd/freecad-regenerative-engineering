# Research Prompt: The Vitruvius Agent - Master of Human Factors, Ergonomics, and Design Harmony

## Core Research Directive

You are tasked with creating a comprehensive philosophical and practical framework for a claude code subagent using its an agent using https://github.com/contextform/freecad-mcp. this AI agent that embodies the principles of human-centered design, ergonomics, and the harmonious integration of form and function. This agent, named after Marcus Vitruvius Pollio whose "De Architectura" established the trinity of firmitas (strength), utilitas (functionality), and venustas (beauty), should represent mastery in designing for human use, comfort, and delight.

## Research Requirements

Please produce a detailed essay (minimum 10,000 words) that covers the following aspects:

### Part 1: Historical and Philosophical Foundation

- Explain static vs. dynamic anthropometry
- Detail joint ranges of motion and comfort zones
- Explore cultural and demographic variations in body dimensions
- Investigate workspace envelopes and reach zones
- Analyze force capabilities and fatigue limits

- Multimodal interaction and sensory integration
- Accessibility for sensory impairments

### Part 5: Physical Ergonomics and Comfort
- Posture analysis and postural stress
- Repetitive strain injury prevention
- Manual material handling guidelines
- Seating design and pressure distribution
- Hand tool design and grip considerations
- Personal protective equipment integration
- Thermal comfort and clothing factors

### Part 6: Universal Design and Accessibility
- Principles of universal design and inclusive design
- ADA compliance and international accessibility standards
- Design for aging populations
- Assistive technology integration
- Temporary and situational disabilities
- Cultural sensitivity in design
- Gender-inclusive design considerations

### Part 7: Safety Engineering and Risk Assessment
- Hazard analysis and risk assessment methodologies
- Fail-safe and fault-tolerant design
- Emergency egress and panic hardware
- Warning labels and safety communication
- Behavioral safety and risk compensation
- Safety culture and design influence on behavior
- Incident investigation and design improvements

### Part 8: User Experience and Interaction Design
- User research methodologies: interviews, observations, surveys
- Task analysis and workflow optimization
- Usability testing and evaluation methods
- Emotional design and aesthetics
- Feedback and affordances
- Consistency and design patterns
- Learnability and expertise development

### Part 9: Integration with FreeCAD and the Agent Ecosystem
- How should the Vitruvius agent evaluate human factors in FreeCAD models?
- What Python libraries should be leveraged (anthropometric databases, ergonomics tools)?
- How should the agent interface with structural (Brunel) and manufacturing (Gabe) constraints?
- What visualization methods should communicate ergonomic issues?
- How should the agent validate designs against standards (ISO, ANSI, DIN)?

### Part 10: Application-Specific Human Factors
- Automotive: driver ergonomics, HVAC comfort, ingress/egress
- Consumer products: packaging, handles, controls, displays
- Medical devices: patient and clinician interfaces, safety-critical design
- Workplace design: offices, manufacturing, control rooms
- Public spaces: wayfinding, crowd flow, emergency evacuation
- Digital interfaces: AR/VR ergonomics, gesture control, voice interaction

### Part 11: Design Evaluation and Validation
- Digital human modeling and simulation
- Rapid prototyping for ergonomic evaluation
- Comfort indices and discomfort assessment
- Performance metrics and productivity measures
- Long-term health impact assessment
- Post-occupancy evaluation and feedback loops

## Specific Questions to Address

1. How should the agent balance ergonomic ideals with manufacturing constraints?
2. What methods can quickly identify potential ergonomic problems in early design?
3. How should designs accommodate the full range of human diversity?
4. What trade-offs exist between adjustability and simplicity?
5. How can beauty (venustas) be quantified or evaluated objectively?
6. What role should emotional design play in functional products?
7. How should the agent handle conflicts between different user groups?
8. What are the ethical implications of designing for "average" users?
9. How should fatigue and long-term use be factored into design decisions?
10. What predictive models can estimate user satisfaction and acceptance?

## Deliverable Format

The essay should:
- Include anthropometric data tables and ergonomic guidelines
- Provide design checklists and evaluation criteria
- Reference current standards (ISO 9241, ANSI/HFES 100, ISO 14738)
- Suggest computational workflows for ergonomic analysis
- Define clear interfaces with other agents in the system
- Include case studies of excellent and poor human factors design
- Balance quantitative ergonomics with qualitative user experience
- Address both physical and cognitive aspects of human-centered design
- Provide methods for inclusive and accessible design

## Research Sources to Consider

- Classic texts: "The Measure of Man" (Dreyfuss), "Design of Everyday Things" (Norman)
- Ergonomics handbooks: Salvendy, Karwowski, Wickens
- Standards organizations: ISO TC 159 (Ergonomics), HFES, BSI
- Anthropometric databases: ANSUR, CAESAR, Size China, DINED
- Journals: Applied Ergonomics, Human Factors, Ergonomics
- Universal design resources: Center for Universal Design, EIDD
- Digital human modeling tools: Jack, RAMSIS, Santos
- Accessibility guidelines: WCAG, Section 508, EN 301 549
- Recent research on inclusive design, emotional design, and neuroergonomics

The final essay should serve as the definitive guide for implementing a human factors and ergonomics agent that can work within the FreeCAD MCP environment, ensuring that designs not only function well mechanically but also provide comfort, safety, and delight to their human users while being accessible to the widest possible range of people.
