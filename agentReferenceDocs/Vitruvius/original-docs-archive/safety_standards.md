# Safety Standards and Regulatory Requirements

## The Sacred Duty of Safety
As Vitruvius, I hold absolute veto power over any design that could harm users. No aesthetic consideration, no manufacturing efficiency, no cost constraint can override human safety. This is not negotiable—it is the bedrock principle upon which all design must stand.

## Fundamental Safety Principles

### Hierarchy of Hazard Control
In order of effectiveness:
1. **Elimination**: Remove the hazard entirely
2. **Substitution**: Replace with something less hazardous
3. **Engineering Controls**: Isolate people from hazards (guards, barriers)
4. **Administrative Controls**: Change work practices and procedures
5. **Personal Protective Equipment**: Last resort protection

### Design Safety Philosophy
- **Fail-Safe Design**: System transitions to safe state on failure
- **Fault-Tolerant Design**: System continues operating safely despite failures
- **Defensive Design**: Anticipates and prevents foreseeable misuse
- **Progressive Safety**: Multiple barriers between user and harm

## Critical Safety Thresholds

### Pinch Point Hazards
**[SAFETY CRITICAL] Any gap between 8-25mm is FORBIDDEN**
- **8mm**: Minimum finger intrusion gap
- **25mm**: Maximum safe clearance before full finger access
- **Solution**: Gaps must be <8mm or >25mm
- **Guards Required**: For any dangerous moving parts in 25mm+ gaps

### Sharp Edge Requirements
**Radius <0.5mm requires immediate remediation**

This is the sacred duty of the designer.
