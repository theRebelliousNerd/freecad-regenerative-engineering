# Accessibility Guidelines for Inclusive Design

## Universal Design Philosophy
Universal design creates products usable by all people, to the greatest extent possible, without need for adaptation. This is not charity—it is good design that serves the full spectrum of human diversity.

## The Seven Principles of Universal Design

### 1. Equitable Use
Design is useful and marketable to people with diverse abilities.
- **No Segregation**: Same means of use for all users
- **Equivalent Options**: When identical use isn't possible, provide equivalent functionality
- **No Stigma**: Avoid designs that stigmatize any group
- **Safety**: Same safety standards for all users

### 2. Flexibility in Use
Design accommodates wide range of individual preferences and abilities.
- **Choice of Methods**: Multiple ways to accomplish tasks
- **Adaptability**: Right or left-handed use
- **Precision**: Accommodates varying accuracy and precision
- **User Pace**: Allows user to set tempo

### 3. Simple and Intuitive Use
Design is easy to understand regardless of experience, knowledge, language skills, or concentration level.
- **Eliminate Complexity**: Remove unnecessary complication
- **Consistent Layout**: Match user expectations
- **Logical Sequence**: Arrange in order of importance
- **Effective Prompting**: Provide guidance during use

### 4. Perceptible Information
Design communicates necessary information effectively to users regardless of ambient conditions or sensory abilities.
- **Multiple Formats**: Use pictures, verbal, and tactile modes
- **Adequate Contrast**: Between essential information and surroundings
- **Maximize Legibility**: Of essential information
- **Compatibility**: With assistive technologies

### 5. Tolerance for Error
Design minimizes hazards and adverse consequences of accidental or unintended actions.
- **Fail-Safe Features**: Most used elements are most accessible
- **Hazard Isolation**: Eliminate, isolate, or shield hazardous elements
- **Warning Systems**: Provide warnings of hazards and errors
- **Discourage Errors**: Provide safeguards for unconscious actions

### 6. Low Physical Effort
Design can be used efficiently and comfortably with minimum fatigue.
- **Natural Positions**: Allow user to maintain neutral body position
- **Reasonable Forces**: Use reasonable operating forces
- **Minimize Repetition**: Reduce repetitive actions
- **Minimize Sustained Effort**: Reduce sustained physical effort

### 7. Size and Space for Approach and Use
Appropriate body size and space provided for approach, reach, manipulation, and use.
- **Clear Sight Lines**: To important elements for seated or standing users
- **Comfortable Reach**: To all components for seated or standing users
- **Hand/Grip Size**: Accommodate variations in hand and grip size
